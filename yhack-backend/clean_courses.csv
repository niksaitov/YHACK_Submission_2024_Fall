344,African Independence: A Cup of Plenty or a Poisoned Chalice?,10373,AFST,"In every African colony after World War Two there emerged nationalist movements which no longer called for civil rights as in the pre-war years but demanded self-determination. While many of them got it easy, some had to fight long and bloody wars for it. By the 1960s the colonial edifice had crumbled except for the few settler colonies in southern Africa. But even here the winds of change could not be stopped. But what did decolonization and independence mean to Africa? Did Africans get what they wanted? Was independence a cup of plenty or a poisoned chalice? In addressing these questions, thiscoursecharts the economic, political, and cultural transformations of postcolonial Africa from the 1960s to the present.

If so, what was the nature of these socialisms and how did they differ from the versions of socialism around the world? What political, social, economic, and cultural ends did socialism serve in Africa? And what were the consequences and legacies of African socialist experiments? The seminar addresses these questions.

363,Our Guinea: Locating Africa in Early Iberian Archives,11798,AFST,"African coastlines were the first horizons of Iberian imperial expansion into the Atlantic, and eventually, the world. While the worlds made by Africans displaced by the slave trade and their descendants have received extensive attention in recent years, Africa itself rarely enters the frame. The histories that unfolded on the continent in many ways challenge our understandings of Spanish and Portuguese expansion and colonialism, shaped as they are by the “New World” paradigm of conquest and conversion.

Many –though not all– of the readings focus on the decades immediately following World War II, when “Pan-Africanism” was an explicit and prominent political discourse. Others address earlier or later examples when the idea of cross-cultural connection was more implicit but equally influential.

465,Infrastructures of Empire: Control and (In)security in the Global South,14958,AFST,"This advanced seminar examines the role that infrastructure plays in producing uneven geographies of power historically and in the “colonial present” (Gregory 2006). After defining terms and exploring the ways that infrastructure has been conceptualized and studied, we analyze how different types of infrastructure (energy, roads, people, and so on) constitute the material and social world of empire. At the same time, infrastructure is not an uncontested arena: it often serves as a key site of political struggle or even enters the fray as an unruly actor itself, thus conditioning possibilities for anti-imperial and decolonial practice. The geographic focus of this course is the African continent, but we explore comparative cases in other regions of the majority and minority world.",['YCSO'],['T 1.30-3.20'],Value Not Provided

Special attention is given to aesthetic experimentation and its relationship to political theater; transformations of genre and form; Black dramatic theory; historical drama; diasporic connections and disconnections; the relationship between music, dance, spectacle, and drama; anti-lynching drama and folk drama; representations of class, gender, and sexuality; inter- and intra-racial conflict; Black radical theatre in the New Deal; and institutional histories of key Black theatre companies.","['YCHU', 'YENJ']",[],Value Not Provided

Du Bois famously theorizes blackness as a serial confrontation with a fundamental question: “How does it feel to be a problem?” This question is in many ways the organizing query of black studies and the devoted preoccupation of this class. Over the course of the semester, we undertake a sustained interrogation of the “problem” of being black, from the advent of racial slavery through to its manifold afterlives. Reading widely across a black literary and intellectual tradition spanning multiple centuries, genres, and disciplines, we explore how black writers not only bear witness to the evolution of the problem of being black over time, but also imagine its redress. Furthermore, we explore how blackness has been conceived as a problem not merely in the conventional sense of an unwelcome condition to be solved or overcome, but also a full and ethical way of dwelling in the world.","['YCHU', 'YENJ']",[],Value Not Provided

We will spend the semester in the company of genies and princes, thieves and slaves, mass murderers, detectives, and orientalists. We will also explore the ways in which the stories of the Nights have been adapted by later writers, such as Djebbar, Stevenson, Conan Doyle, and Mahfouz, as well as by filmmakers such Pasolini and—of course—Walt Disney.

430,Muslims in the United States,11780,AMST,"Since 9/11, cases of what has been termed “home-grown terrorism” have cemented the fear that “bad” Islam is not just something that exists far away, in distant lands. As a result, there has been an urgent interest to understand who American Muslims are by officials, experts, journalists, and the public. Although Muslims have been part of America’s story from its founding, Muslims have alternated from an invisible minority to the source of national moral panics, capturing national attention during political crises, as a cultural threat or even a potential fifth column. Today the stakes are high to understand what kinds of meanings and attachments connect Muslims in America to the Muslim world and to the US as a nation.Over the course of the semester, students grapple with how to define and apply the slippery concept of diaspora to different dispersed Muslim populations in the US, including racial and ethnic diasporas, trading diasporas, political diasporas, and others.

Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity.

How wide is the gap? How can we bridge it? How pervasive is the problem? This course introduces first-year students to writing in the discipline of philosophy by tracing the contours of these questions and exploring their answers in ancient China, ancient Greece, and modern analytic philosophy. We begin by considering the traditional account of weakness of will as akrasia (i.e., doing what one knows one shouldn’t do) and explaining how such a gap in our agency is or isn’t possible. Next, we consider an alternative account, that of acedia (i.e., not doing what one knows one should do), and assess strategies for helping an agent bridge this kind of gap.

422,Early Film Theory and Modernity,13373,HUMS,"For a long time, early film theory and criticism have been overlooked and underestimated. However, their recent rediscovery has highlighted their crucial role in framing film as a ""modern"" invention. While discussing what then was a recent invention, early film theory and criticism tackled some of the main characteristic of modern life: speed, excitation, contingency, openness, subjectivity, circulation, etc. By doing so, they underscored the parallel between modern experience and filmic representations. On the screen –they claimed– spectators do not only see the world in which they live, but also the effects of the political, industrial, and social revolutions on this world. At the same time, early film theory and criticism developed an ideal of “modern” art and “modern” language, through a systematic exploration of filmic style and iconography. According to them, film was the epitome of a “new art” for “new times.” The course explores the idea of modernity as it developed in the Western world between...",['YCHU'],"['MW 9.00-10.15', '1 HTBA']",Value Not Provided

Anchored in case studies thathelp to understand the core challenges of our discipline, we explore the relation of literary study to anthropology, linguistics, religious studies, history, and cognitive science.

We address these questions in a global sense as much as we can: while the culture of Western modernity will figure very prominently in the readings and discussion, we take a more enlarged perspective, with some of the readings being about, and/or from, places and imaginaries beyond the West: China, Afrofuturism, and South Asia.

It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research?

With the use of secondary works and primary sources, students gain some familiarity with the queens themselves, their struggles to use and retain power, and the cultures in which those queens were embedded. Over the duration of the course, students form a basic idea of what queenship has entailed across cultures, while simultaneously discovering how queenship varied in different cultures and material circumstances. The course thereby not only investigates queenship, but also serves as an introduction to the temporal, spatial, and conceptual breadth of world history. And, through watching recent film and television depictions of these queens, students come to grips with the problem of historical memory and the uses (or abuses) to which history can be put.","['PREI', 'YCHU', 'YCWR']",[],Enrollment limited to first-year students.

By examining fictional and non-fictional texts, including readings in psychoanalysis, pedagogical theory, contemporary parenting advice, and political and sociological analysis, we seek to understand seemingly natural or eternal aspects of human life (“childhood,” “the family”) as historically and socially constructed and, thus, as sites for political struggle and creative transformation. We conclude by discussing children’s literature and film, and the conflicting visions of childhood and “the future” these forms offer to adults and children.","['YCHU', 'YCWR']","['MW 11.35-12.50', 'F 1.00-4.00']",Enrollment limited to first-year students.

Why do we consider them our ‘best friends’? And is this always true? If not, why do we sometimes fear dogs? What role have dogs played in our understanding of being human? This course explores images of dogs in 20th-21st Italian literature through six main categories: a man and his dog; dogs and inhumanity; dogs and exile; dogs and children; dogs and folktales; dogs and modern bestiary. We discuss and close read a variety of texts, which are representative of different strategies for reflecting on the self and on the ‘other’ by unpacking the unstable relationship between anthropomorphism, personification, and humanization.

We read both critics and advocates of liberalism. We also examine it historically, sociologically, and comparatively, in order to gain a better sense of what it means in practice, and how it differs from the arguments of both its most strong supporters and defenders, and its critics.

We then examine the paradigmatic ethical act of giving as embodied by two great virtuous exemplars: the Buddha (archetypal renunciate) and Vessantara (archetypal layman). From there, we turn to case studies of ethical cultivation and negotiation in three realms of Buddhist practice: the Vinaya precepts governing monastic life, the altruism and skillful means of bodhisattvas, and the antinomian ethics of Buddhist tantra.

259,Muslim Societies in Africa,14698,RLST,"While the Western academy has long devoted attention to Africa and Islam, it has not commonly treated the two together. Their estrangement in the literature belies the significance of Islam in Africa and conversely of Africa within the wider Islamic World. Indeed, today Africans constitute nearly a third of the global Muslim community. Islam enjoys a rich history on the continent, stretching from the migration of Muslims to seventh-century Abyssinia to the Islamic kingdoms of nineteenth-century West Africa. This course seeks to reimagine Africa not as a periphery but as a center of the Islamic World.

293,Reform and Continuity in Islamic law,16313,RLST,"This course aims to provide students with an alternative reading of the Islamic legal tradition. It upends the view that Islamic law was in some way allergic to change. Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence (fiqh), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God’s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions (fatwās) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course...",['YCHU'],['W 3.30-5.20'],Value Not Provided

Many societies eventually put in place welfare systems that shielded individuals from the worst vagaries of economic life. Democracy and capitalism could thus coexist.

Highlighting how gender and sexual minorities, and the gendered regulation of life, more broadly, both animate and contest colonial legacies tied to a racialized notion of “modernity.” Through ethnography, history, and literature, students confront a political economy of intimacies that continuously reshape what it means to be or not to be a citizen. Our approach extends beyond borders and laws to include the everyday acts of citizenship that rework race, religion, and ethnicity across transnational fronts. We discuss how people navigate their lives in the everyday, from the ordinary poetry of identity and belonging to the spectacular drama of war and conflict.

We investigate this structure of intimacy through theoretical, historical, ethnographic, literary, and visual materials and think about the various meanings of monogamy historically as well as transnationally. Monogamy is entangled with relations of private property, with colonial civilizational narratives, with scientific theories about human nature. Polygamy in return has historically been understood as religious and/or cultural difference, and as a remnant of pre-modernity.

Engaging literature on embodiment from diverse disciplines—including philosophy, anthropology, and cognitive science—this course investigates how cultural understandings of the body inform the meaning of artmaking and art-experiencing practices. Discussions center on artworks from Latin America from the Pre-Hispanic to the Contemporary period—including Nazca lines, Maya ceramics, colonial-era mopa mopa, the early 20th-century Anthropophagy movement in Brazil, Hélio Oiticica’s and Lygia Clark’s works from the 1950s and 1970s, and the works of Beatriz Gonzales and Doris Salcedo from the 1980s and 1990s.

This discussion seminar reinterprets histories of modern architecture through the concept of “energy cultures.” An energy culture (Sheller, 2014; Szeemann and Diamanti, 2019) can be defined as the specific assemblage of fuel, matter, practice, labor, and meaning that have informed architecture’s conceptualization and construction. In contrast to approaches that stress quantitative, technical, and instrumental approaches to energy accounting and energy efficiency, this course looks at how different representations, concepts, and behaviors emerged in response to historic shifts in energy production and consumption.

During this era, builders pushed an earlier tradition of gothic design toward unprecedented heights of structural daring and ornamental expression. At the same time, they found inspiration in ancient pagan and non-European monuments, which offered alternative models of technical virtuosity, material splendor, and magnificence. Engineers invented fortifications of colossal scale to combat powerful gunpowder weapons, while new media such as print transmitted architectural designs across the globe.This course explores such developments across Europe and its cultural and colonial networks in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Many distinct cultures adapted to lush Amazonian forests, extreme altitudes of the Andes Mountains, parched desert coasts in the Pacific, and freezing Pacific waters. In order to survive, these civilizations developed unique relationships with the landscape and its resources, such as potatoes, coca leaves, marine life, cotton, alpaca, and metals like silver, gold, and copper. These relationships were significantly transformed by the arrival of the Spanish, resulting in social upheaval, religious conversion, new economies, the development of hybrid artistic styles, and ecological catastrophes.

When we are not shooting or editing in class we exercise our critical skills by screening projects and discussing them. We take experimental approaches to the process of making these 10 videos as we glance toward the standard cinematic categories of drama, documentary, experimental film, and animation as we glide past. These categories are familiar, but not always productive, divisions among modes of production since none of these categories defines clear boundaries between practices.

431,The Other Side of French and Francophone Cinema,10261,FILM,"What is the story of French and Francophone Cinema if told by other countries? May an external point of view engender a new interpretative move towards familiar topics and subjects? If French cinematography and its historical, aesthetical, and political evolutions has mainly unfolded from an internal and national standpoint, studies in transnational cinema demonstrate the impact of cultural circulations on the making of films and on the evolution of artistic movements. By examining how French and Francophone Cinema is seen and commented on from abroad--whether in the context of collaborations between countries or the way films and filmmakers are exposed, valorized, or on the contrary, silenced--this course puts into perspective the decisive role of external influences. We revisit early French films, canonical art works and different film productions from French-speaking countries while challenging monocultural interpretative paradigms.

460,Sound/Image Practice,10263,FILM,"We start from the assumption that sound is actually the ‘secret-sauce’ in the film/videomaking process. Often overlooked–or at least neglected, sound is a potent tool to advance the logic of a film or video and even more, to enhance the emotional patina and immersive engagement of a film or video. Sound becomes an accessible portal to the perhaps overlooked not-quite-conscious realm of the film/video experience. While we certainly read some theory/history of sound, this is primarily a class of making. The first 7 weeks include videomaking exercises designed to highlight specific challenges in sound for picture. The core concern is with conceptual development in the myriad ways that sound and picture work together. There is no genre or mode preference in this class.

Vilém Flusser once remarked that the composite essence of digital technology was already embedded in photography because the photographic image is an image composed of points, which the human eye synthesizes into an image. This seminar proposes not only to revisit Flusser’s notion of the “technical image” in light of today’s changes in visual culture but also to rethink the history of image technologies beyond (or beneath) their visual dimensions. Starting with 15th- and 16th-century perspectival images and drawing tools—from Alberti’s “veil” to Dürer’s grid—, we trace the origins of the digital image with detours in the history of textile and the invention of the Jacquard loom, patented in 1804. Subsequently, the course analyzes 19th-century optical devices and so-called philosophical toys that required manual operation to produce the illusion of a moving image, fooling the human eye.

382,Cinema as Room for Play,13272,FILM,"In 1936, Walter Benjamin observed that the loss of the aura was compensated by an enormous gain in “room-for-play” (Spiel-Raum), which, as he claimed, was the widest in film. What is left of this Spiel-Raum in cinema today? And how was it explored in the past decades? Was it limited to avant-garde practices or did it also expand to mainstream cinema? And what about the spectators? Is Benjamin’s notion turning them into players? This seminar proposes to rethink cinema as a form of play and to make connections, throughout history, with other playful media practices. Can for instance the Internet with its numerous GIF makers and social media platforms be considered as the new Spiel-Raum? How are contemporary online loops related to 19th-century optical toys and proto-cinematic slot machines? What made cinema the medium of “suspension of disbelief,” which is a form of pretend play?

What would characterize, and would distinguish, migration, diaspora, and exile cinemas? What are the artistic and mediatic outcomes of constant movements due to economic, cultural, political or humanitarian needs? And reversely, how do cinema reflect these issues?

This course employs a keywords approach to offer a historical, albeit nonlinear, account of domestic spectatorship. Built around a set of theoretical debates and watershed moments--from black-and-white to color, analog to digital, standard to high-definition, and broadcast to cable--we explore how people have engaged with television in a variety of ways. Who is the imaginary spectator? Is it the distracted suburban housewife, the child subjected to an “electronic babysitter,” or, more recently, the early adopter of new technologies?

As such they condition, shape, and transform our daily lives: Algorithms play a crucial role in deciding which clothes we buy, which songs we listen to, which books we read, who we might date, and how much we would pay for a flight ticket. They help shift political opinions and shape cultural tastes. However, the logic on which algorithmic systems are based and the infrastructures that sustain them are still largely unknown to their users (and, increasingly, to their developers).

Questions arise from several disparate directions. Some argue that incorporating moral judgments in the foreign policy decision-making is at odds with the pursuit of U.S. national interests. Others believe that American exceptionalism – the belief that the United States must act as a force for good in the world – is intrinsic to its national security and provides it with a unique comparative advantage vis-à-vis competing powers. Still others challenge the United States’ effectiveness in pursuing a values-centered foreign policy, its sincerity, or both -- pointing to a history in which the exercise of American power has had devastating consequences for its purported beneficiaries, or been marred by blatant double standards and hypocrisy.

Aristotle’s conflation of matter with error suggests error as able to provides a ‘way-in’ to the (always closed) question of matter. Might the symptomatic excess of precision that the century witnessed, inflated beyond practicable performance, signal nothing less than the architect’s fear of matter itself? As precision, already a promiscuous term, became uncoupled from its contract with truthfulness, error, and the always-political space of its identification, reconfigured in newly unpredictable ways.

In addressing these questions, this&#160;course&#160;charts the economic, political, and cultural transformations of postcolonial Africa from the 1960s to the present.

A,396,Revolutions and Socialist Experiments in Africa,10378,AFST,"<p>This seminar explores the contours of Africa’s embrace and engagement with the most influential ideology of the twentieth-century. Why, and through which channels, were Africans attracted to socialism? Did particular forms of colonialism and decolonization push African political actors towards revolution and socialist experiments? Is it legitimate, as some scholars have suggested, to speak of genuinely African socialisms? If so, what was the nature of these socialisms and how did they differ from the versions of socialism around the world? What political, social, economic, and cultural ends did socialism serve in Africa? And what were the consequences and legacies of African socialist experiments? The seminar addresses these questions. Our goal is to place Africa in the mainstream of conversations about socialism. We begin with the assumption that, like any doctrine, socialism was the object of multiple interpretations, modification, and appropriation from its inception. In so doing, we challenge orthodox understandings of socialism, which hold the European versions as the pure models and the rest as diluted if not populist façades of the ‘true’ doctrine.&#160;We begin with theoretical readings that help us situate the major debates about socialism in general and socialism in Africa. We then proceed to examine the overall historical context in which African nationalists adopted socialism. We differentiate the first branch of “African Socialism” from the second wave of “Afro-Marxism.” We also pay close attention to issues of decolonization and political imagination; ideas and experiments of development; gender, morality, and social engineering.&#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",0,['Benedito Machava'],['24306255'],[],['T 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C15'],[],,HIST396J,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,African Socialist Experiments,AFST,AFST396,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98436/assignments/syllabus,202403

We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France.

Du Bois famously theorizes blackness as a serial confrontation with a fundamental question: “How does it feel to be a problem?” This question is in many ways the organizing query of black studies and the devoted preoccupation of this class. Over the course of the semester, we undertake a sustained interrogation of the “problem” of being black, from the advent of racial slavery through to its manifold afterlives. Reading widely across a black literary and intellectual tradition spanning multiple centuries, genres, and disciplines, we explore how black writers not only bear witness to the evolution of the problem of being black over time, but also imagine its redress. Furthermore, we explore how blackness has been conceived as a problem not merely in the conventional sense of an unwelcome condition to be solved or overcome, but also a full and ethical way of dwelling in the world.</p>","['YCHU', 'YENJ']",0,[],[],[],[],[],[],,AFAM364,YC,Yale College,[],01,C,,Blackness and the Problem,ENGL,ENGL277,,202403

We will spend the semester in the company of genies and princes, thieves and slaves, mass murderers, detectives, and orientalists. We will also explore the ways in which the stories of the Nights have been adapted by later writers, such as Djebbar, Stevenson, Conan Doyle, and Mahfouz, as well as by filmmakers such Pasolini and—of course—Walt Disney. The course is intended to introduce students to the major tales of the Nights and to the classical Arabic literary tradition more broadly.

Over the course of the semester, we read broadly across several genres of African American literature, including: slave narrative, fiction, poetry, drama and memoir. In this way, we center the unique environmental perspectives of those, who, once considered no more than livestock,&#160;<em>were</em>&#160;the nature over which their white masters ruled. Indeed, as those who were drowned in the ocean during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, forced to cultivate the soil on slave plantations, and hung from trees across the Jim Crow South, black Americans are bound up and entangled in nature in incredibly complex and precarious ways. Perhaps for this very reason, however, we may ultimately come to find in these black nature stories the resources for reclaiming a proper relationship to the Earth, and for imagining a sustainable human life in nature, rather than apart from it.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Jonathan Howard'],['24624903'],[],['MW 11.35-12.50'],['WALL82 102'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Enrollment limited to first-year students.</p>",,YC,Yale College,['AFAM017'],01,A,,Blk Amer Nature: AFAM Writing,ENGL,ENGL006,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99377/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,368,The Novel and the Nation: Reading India in Vikram Seth’s <i>A Suitable Boy</i>,12245,ENGL,"<p>This course pairs two interconnected phenomena: the rise of the Indian Republic and the birth of the postcolonial novel. Over the course of the semester, we read a single primary text: Vikram Seth’s&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;(1993). Set in the 1950s in the aftermath of India’s Independence and Partition, Seth’s encyclopaedic novel is the story of four families brought together by a mother’s search for a “suitable boy” for her daughter to marry. In the process, it builds a microcosm of an Indian society coming to terms with postcolonial statehood and weighing the aftereffects of British colonialism. Entwined in its plot about marriage, love, and relationships are some of the most urgent cultural and political concerns facing the new nation: legislative changes and land reforms, the violent aftermath of the Partition, secularism tainted by communal tensions, the disintegration of courtly forms of sociality, the reconstruction of city life, and the fate of the English novel in the postcolonial classroom.&#160;We read&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;as literary critics and historians, pairing close readings of language and literary form with historical scholarship. Over the course of our discussions, we address the following questions: what is the relationship between the nation, the novel, and identity in the postcolonial world? How do we read narratives of “nation building” as literary and cultural constructions? What do we make of “literature” and “history” as disciplinary categories and formations? The seminar introduces students to methods of literary criticism and textual studies, and teaches them how to read a range of primary sources, from legislative debates, bureaucratic reports, newspapers, poetry, cinema, and radio.</p>","['YCHU', 'YENS']",0,"['Priyasha Mukhopadhyay', 'Rohit De']","['17597108', '12160377']",[],['M 1.30-3.20'],['LC 104'],[],,,YC,Yale College,"['HIST341J', 'SAST474']",01,A,,Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy,ENGL,ENGL368,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99480/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,229,What Was Reading?,12331,ENGL,"<p>This course takes a long and curious view of the history of reading, using primary sources, material objects, historical records, and contemporary debates to unsettle our assumptions about what reading is and does. How have ideas about the meaning and purpose of reading changed over time? What methods or goals have fallen out of favor, and which continue to shape our ideologies of reading today? What relation is there between the reading we do in a Yale English class, and the reading we do on the beach, or at synagogue, or online―and where do those different sorts of reading come from? The syllabus focuses on early modern English literature, but it also engages ongoing debates about reading in the present, seeking both to link them to and distinguish them from earlier controversies. For instance, a unit on reading as religion raises questions about the morally improving (or morally destabilizing) effects of scriptural interpretation that then haunt later debates about the merits and limitations of anti-racist reading, as James Baldwin argues; similarly, early arguments about the effeminating influence of certain books--especially those aimed at women or young readers--give rise to assumptions about gender and genre that still shape our ambivalence toward reading for pleasure. As we explore these older efforts to shape, inform, regulate, or liberate reading, we’ll also experiment with our own readerly practices, using forgotten or neglected forms like the commonplace book, the moral commentary, or the meditation as foils to the more usual modes of academic writing.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR', 'YENJ']",0,['Catherine Nicholson'],['12697985'],[],['MW 2.30-3.45'],['LC 204'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,What Was Reading?,ENGL,ENGL229,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99534/assignments/syllabus,202403
A,240,Queen Victoria and Victorian Literature,12332,ENGL,"<p>What made the Victorian era “Victorian”? How did Queen Victoria shape the period of British history and culture named for her; how was the monarchy of this long-lived and strong-willed queen in turn shaped by the era over which she reigned? To what extent was the queen’s image created by the popular figures of her that proliferated as new media arose across the period, and to what extent did she actively forge her own image? What were the queen’s powers as a female monarch–and, later, empress–who was a wife, a widow, and a mother, and how did she influence the roles of women in her day and after? This course addresses these questions by reading the queen’s own published literary works, <em>Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands</em> and <em>More Leaves</em>; by viewing works of visual art created under her patronage; and by reading biographical and fictional works about the queen and about Victorian queenship, such as Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s poems, Lewis Carroll’s <em>Alice </em>books, George Eliot’s <em>Felix Holt</em>, Margaret Oliphant’s <em>Miss Marjoribanks</em>, and Rider Haggard’s <em>She</em>.

Some of our time goes toward identifying the racial and colonial logics as well as presumptions about gender and ability that inform the conventions, genres, and styles of scholarly prose. For example, we contemplate the power relations and tonal effects embedded in the familiar maneuvers of advancing and defending arguments. Most of the class’s energy, however, is devoted to testing out less combative modes of inhabiting the page. We pursue these experiments not in the name of novelty but with the hope that our compositional practices can move us toward different values and different futures for writing, conversing, and living as subjects of the university. To guide us in this endeavor, we look to scholars who have critiqued the politics of knowledge by mobilizing alternative styles of knowing.

A,463,Writing Outsiderness and Interiority,12664,ENGL,"<p>The essayist, the writer of non-fiction, has historically been an oracle of opinions that most often go unsaid.&#160;They do not traditionally reinforce a sense of insular collectivity, instead they often steer us towards a radical understanding of the moment that they write from. The best essayists unearth and organize messages from those most at the margins: the ignored, the exiled, the criminal, and the destitute. So, by writing about these people, the essayist is fated, most nobly or just as ignobly, to write about the ills and aftermaths of their nation’s worse actions. It is an obligation and also a very heavy burden.&#160;In this class we examine how the essay and many essayists have functioned as geographers of spaces that have long been forgotten. And we read a series of non-fiction pieces that trouble the question of interiority, belonging, the other, and outsiderness. And we attempt to do a brief but comprehensive review of the essay as it functions as a barometer of the author’s times. This is accomplished by reading the work of such writers as: Herodotus, William Hazlitt, Doris Lessing, Audre Lorde, Gay Talese, Binyavanga Wainaina, Jennifer Clement, V.S. Naipaul, Sei Shonagon, George Orwell, Margo Jefferson, Tobi Haslett, and Joan Didion.&#160;</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah'],['24949059'],[],['Th 1.30-3.20'],['LC 205'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Outsiderness & Interiority,ENGL,ENGL463,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99771/assignments/syllabus,202403

We focus primarily on American TV history—from the Big Three of the 1940s-1970s (CBS, NBC, ABC), through cable’s reign in the 1980s and 90s (CNN, MTV, BET), and the mega-mergers that have transformed the media environment of the new millennium (AOL-Time Warner, Disney-Fox). We conclude the course by looking at transnational TV franchises (<em>Idol, Next Top Model, Love Island</em>), state-operated TV (Britain’s BBC and Russia’s VGTRK), and by considering what <em>local</em> television means in an era of global media conglomerates.

Our readings and discussions consider the extent to which the ""Asia"" that emerges in twentieth-century American literary and visual culture was a product of not only powerful (and often powerfully racist) Euro-American visions of Asian ""others,"" but also dialogic re-imaginations of Asia created by Asian-Americans themselves. Questions that the course addresses include: In what sense is ""Asia"" an aesthetic category in American literary and visual culture? What role does genre play in the circulation and recirculation of American images of Asia during the twentieth century?

Readings also address the image of the ghost in popular and political culture, including the image of the Jews, women, and the repressed Other. Students are expected to ""ghost"" passages in the voices of their classmates, as well as in the voices of prominent figures. Secondary topics include the phenomena of collective writing and human-AI collaboration.&#160;Academic integrity is enforced according to the rules and regulations established by the Yale College Writing Center.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR', 'YENW']",50,['Joshua Cohen'],['11334432'],[],['Th 1.30-3.20'],['LC 209'],[],,,YC,Yale College,['ENGL431'],01,A,,Ghostwriting,JDST,JDST345,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100600/assignments/syllabus,202403

The period under discussion begins after the death of Stalin in 1953 and ends with the art of protest against the modern post-Soviet dictatorships of Alexander Lukashenka in Belarus and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the protest art of the Ukrainian Maidan and the anti-war movement of artists against the Russian-Ukrainian war.&#160;The course begins by looking at the influence of the “Khrushchev Thaw” on literature and cinema, which opened the way for protest art to a wide Soviet audience. We explore different approaches to protest art in conditions of political unfreedom: ""nonconformism,"" ""dissidence,"" ""mimicry,"" ""rebellion.""&#160;The course investigates the existential conflict of artistic freedom and the political machine of authoritarianism. These themes are explored at different levels through specific examples from the works and biographies of artists.

A,293,Politics of Performance,11643,GMAN,"<p>The stage is, and always has been, a political space. Ever since its beginnings, theatre has offered ways to rethink and criticize political systems, with the stage serving as a “moral institution” (Schiller) but also as a laboratory for models of representation. The stage also delineates the limits of representation for democratic societies (Rousseau), as it offers the space for experimentation and new modes of being together, being <em>ensemble</em>. The stage also raises the question of its own condition of possibility and the networks it depends on (Jackson).&#160;This course revisits the history of German and German speaking theatre since the Enlightenment, and discusses the stage in its relationship to war, the nation state, the social question, femicide and gender politics, the Holocaust, globalization, and 21st century migration.

A,471,Directed Independent Study,11784,THST,"<p>An independent study should generally conform to the standards and procedures of the senior project, THST 491, even when not undertaken by a senior. If the independent study is a performance or directing project, the adviser visits rehearsals and performances at the mutual convenience of adviser and student. The project must be accompanied by an essay of about fifteen pages, worth about half the final grade. Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before—not after—the final performance. The final version of the paper, incorporating adjustments and reflections, should be turned in to the adviser no later than ten days after the performance closes, and no later than the first day of the final examination period. An essay project entails substantial reading, at least four meetings with the adviser, and a paper or papers totaling at least twenty pages. A playwriting project normally requires twenty new script pages every two weeks of the term and regular meetings with the adviser. A final draft of the entire script is the culmination of the term's work. Application forms are available from the director of undergraduate studies.

We read contemporary theorizations of performer training (or, where they don’t exist, devise them ourselves).

We examine the use of language and typography as an imperfect and malleable literary road map including, but not limited to, argument, rhythm, tempo, and musicality, all of which actors may access and combine with their own craft to begin to unleash the works’ theatrical potential. Progressing from monologues and soliloquys, to scenes, and solo performance, the course also, to a limited degree, allows students to consider and deploy elements of stagecraft including properties, costumes, and music, especially in one short performance project at the end of the semester.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['James Bundy'],['11479408'],[],['F 1.30-5.20'],['YK220 101'],[],,,YC,Yale College,['ENGL211'],01,A,,Acting Shakespeare,THST,THST315,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100443/assignments/syllabus,202403

With a range of invited speakers sharing recent work on this theme – including partners of Arakawa and Gins ""Reversible Destiny"" architecture; disability and performance scholar Petra Kuppers on ""Eco Soma,"" and ornthologist Richard Prum on performativity in biological natural selection – we will consider how embodied processes of evolution, healing, and creativity partner with the earth itself as the largest body we as a species interact with on a daily basis.&#160;Students enrolled for credit complete weekly readings based on that week’s scholarship.

Every performance holds a multitude of people, places, and histories, and this course trains students to bring their creative and critical skills more thoughtfully to any artistic experience. To study the worlds inside performance requires movement through literature (including poetry and novels), aesthetic criticism (scholarly and journalistic), historical texts, and attendance at live events. As every performance holds a legacy of many others, students learn to sense the dynamic traditions enacted inside them. The skill set developed in this seminar is portable across the humanities for its solid introductions to archival research, the field of Performance Studies, descriptive writing, historical inquiry, and critical analysis.

Over the course of the semester, we undertake a sustained interrogation of the “problem” of being black, from the advent of racial slavery through to its manifold afterlives. Reading widely across a black literary and intellectual tradition spanning multiple centuries, genres, and disciplines, we explore how black writers not only bear witness to the evolution of the problem of being black over time, but also imagine its redress.

Grounded in four different geographies, this course examines how the interrelationships of place, race, and memory are implicated in reforms of preK-12 schools in the United States. The course uses an interdisciplinary approach to study these phenomena, borrowing from commensurate frameworks in sociology, anthropology, political science, and memory studies with the goal of examining multiple angles and perspectives on a given issue.</p>",['YCSO'],0,['Errol Saunders'],['11547510'],[],['W 3.30-5.20'],['HQ 401'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">EDST 110 recommended.</p>",EDST263,YC,Yale College,['AMST263'],01,A,,"Place, Race, Memory in Schools",AFAM,AFAM261,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99347/assignments/syllabus,202403

And how do these stories shape our understanding of what it means to be human?&#160;In contrast to a largely white tradition of nature writing that assumes a superior position outside of Nature, this course undertakes a broad survey of African American nature writing. Over the course of the semester, we read broadly across several genres of African American literature, including: slave narrative, fiction, poetry, drama and memoir. In this way, we center the unique environmental perspectives of those, who, once considered no more than livestock,&#160;<em>were</em>&#160;the nature over which their white masters ruled. Indeed, as those who were drowned in the ocean during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, forced to cultivate the soil on slave plantations, and hung from trees across the Jim Crow South, black Americans are bound up and entangled in nature in incredibly complex and precarious ways. Perhaps for this very reason, however, we may ultimately come to find in these black nature stories the resources for reclaiming a proper relationship to the Earth, and for imagining a sustainable human life in nature, rather than apart from it.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Jonathan Howard'],['24624903'],[],['MW 11.35-12.50'],['WALL82 102'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Enrollment limited to first-year students.</p>",,YC,Yale College,['ENGL006'],01,A,,Blk Amer Nature: AFAM Writing,AFAM,AFAM017,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99377/assignments/syllabus,202403

Learning about the performative side of politics, with real life material, we familiarize ourselves with narratives and deep stories told by people across the political spectrum.

A,451,Introduction to the Occult Sciences,13184,HSHM,"<p>This course provides a comparative history of the occult sciences from antiquity to the present. From Galen’s occult properties to Newton’s pursuit of alchemy, the notion that there are hidden forces in nature has played an immeasurable role in the development of religious thought, scientific reasoning, and literary endeavor. The modern impulse to separate religion from science and science from magic can obscure the centrality of an array of practices and beliefs across time and place. Far from a disenchanted present, magic and the occult are woven through the fabric of modernity. From healing crystals to the personalized astrology of Co-Star, tarot cards to New-Age inflected conspiracy theories, fortune tellers to countless films, we are surrounded by appeals to occult powers. Building on case studies from classical antiquity and Jewish, Christian, and Islamic letters, this course traces the development of the occult sciences through an array of historical periods, social contexts, and discursive materials. Topics include: origins of writing, astrology, alchemy, medicine, natural philosophy, divination, automata, talismans, natural magic, letterism, hermeticism, kabbalah, Neoplatonism, recipes for summoning demons and angels, persecution, orientalism, colonialism, mesmerism, spiritualism, disenchantment, modernity, capitalism, consumption, and fantasy. Materials are drawn from an array of sources, including: philosophical dialogues, scientific manuals, illuminated manuscripts, encyclopedias, cosmographies, handbooks of practical magic, collections of stories, and movies. In addition to a panoply of primary sources and contemporary scholarship on theory and method, students are introduced to a variety of archival materials in the Yale collections.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Travis Zadeh'],['17106828'],[],['TTh 10.30-11.20'],['HQ L02'],[],,RLST108,YC,Yale College,['HUMS108'],01,A,,Intro to the Occult Sciences,HSHM,HSHM451,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100133/assignments/syllabus,202403

After defining terms and exploring the ways that infrastructure has been conceptualized and studied, we analyze how different types of infrastructure (energy, roads, people, and so on) constitute the material and social world of empire. At the same time, infrastructure is not an uncontested arena: it often serves as a key site of political struggle or even enters the fray as an unruly actor itself, thus conditioning possibilities for anti-imperial and decolonial practice.

We begin by examining the impact of colonialism on health systems, highlighting the introduction of Western medicine that dismantled local health systems and established healthcare infrastructures that primarily served colonial and elite interests. We then explore the rise of international health organizations, such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the League of Nations Health Organization (LNHO), and the World Health Organization (WHO), and the role of multilateral institutions in shaping global and local health policy in the postwar period. We also evaluate health missions between the Socialist bloc and the Third World and assess the successes and limitations of these alternative visions for promoting health equity. Over the course of the semester, we examine the experiences of health interventions and eradication programs from the perspective of recipient communities and gain an understanding of resistance, contestations, and adoption of these programs. Challenging dominant narratives that portray recipients of global health projects as passive, we evaluate how marginalized communities have variously resisted, appropriated, and shaped global technologies and ideas. Importantly, rather than following a linear North (donor) -to-South (recipient) model, we examine how the contemporary global health landscape emerged as the result of the exchange of ideas, technologies, and local knowledge and expertise between the Global North and South</p>",['YCHU'],24,['Gourav Krishna Nandi'],['17054281'],[],['TTh 11.35-12.50'],['BASS 305'],[],,,YC,Yale College,['HIST463'],01,A,,Politics Global Hlth 1850-Pres,HSHM,HSHM233,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/102913/assignments/syllabus,202403

By focusing on scientific societies, surveys, botany, medicine, and sanitation, the course first demonstrates how colonial rule viewed India as a field for experiments and also applying of scientific knowledge already established in Europe. We then examine how technological changes facilitated the colonial rule's aim of securing fiscal resources, connecting hinterlands to markets, ensuring relentless passage of information, and ensuring everyday surveillance. By exploring the histories of irrigation, railways, telegraph, electrification, and urban transportation, the lectures for this section demonstrate how the Empire governed through built networks. In exploring the modalities of colonial power, we note how it functioned by asserting that scientific enterprises and technological changes would 'improve' the condition of Indians, ensure their passage into 'civilization,' and consolidate their dwellings therein. However, we also observe that it denied that Indians would ever be civilized enough to utilize and build on these developments.

A,222,Pop Sapphism,11060,AMST,"<p>Lesbian popular culture, despite rare waves of visibility, is construed as generically niche and embalmed in past eras like the 1970s and 1990s. As we enter deeper into the millennium, the lesbian presence in pop—from music and literature, to film, TV, and other media—is revivified through the more expansive sexual and aesthetic imaginary of “sapphism,” a term that signals the explicitly gay, as well as the more implicitly “queer coded.” Female-identified artists and creators, whether they’re out or not, inspire a sapphic pop culture comprised of both artists and a robust fan culture, that calls upon the historical archives and intimate reading practices of lesbian cultures and queer theory, including the resurgence of Sapphic poetry itself. This seminar revisits the key historical and aesthetic touchstones of “sapphism,” while engaging contemporary iterations of sapphic pop culture, from figures like K-Stew (Kristen Stewart), Janelle Monae, and a slew of “converted” reality contestants, to the controversies surrounding “Gaylorism” itself. The seminar teaches genealogical and historiographic approaches to sexuality studies, along with techniques of close reading and analysis in Queer Studies—especially recent books on lesbian aesthetics, as well as earlier iterations queer of color critique.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Karen Tongson'],['25448094'],[],['M 9.25-11.15'],['HQ 113'],[],,WGSS226,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Pop Sapphism,AMST,AMST222,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98809/assignments/syllabus,202403

Considering Haiti's war of independence in the broader context of the Age of Revolutions, we cover topics such as enlightenment thought, natural history, the workings and politics of the printing press, and representations of the Haitian Revolution in art, literature, music, and in various kinds of historical writings and archival documents.

We focus on issues concerning race and gender in the context of colonialism, postcolonialism, and migration. The course investigates how the silencing of colonial history has been made possible culturally and ideologically, and how this silencing has in turn been central to the reorganizing of French culture and society from the period of decolonization to the present. We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness.&#160;Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the ""beur"" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Fadila Habchi'],['13947043'],[],['W 1.30-3.20'],['WALL82 101'],[],,ER&M467,YC,Yale College,"['FREN481', 'AFAM457', 'AFST457']",01,A,,AfricanLit:PostcolonialFrance,AMST,AMST470,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99231/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,430,Muslims in the United States,11780,AMST,"<p>Since 9/11, cases of what has been termed “home-grown terrorism” have cemented the fear that “bad” Islam is not just something that exists far away, in distant lands. As a result, there has been an urgent interest to understand who American Muslims are by officials, experts, journalists, and the public. Although Muslims have been part of America’s story from its founding, Muslims have alternated from an invisible minority to the source of national moral panics, capturing national attention during political crises, as a cultural threat or even a potential fifth column. Today the stakes are high to understand what kinds of meanings and attachments connect Muslims in America to the Muslim world and to the US as a nation.&#160;Over the course of the semester, students grapple with how to define and apply the slippery concept of diaspora to different dispersed Muslim populations in the US, including racial and ethnic diasporas, trading diasporas, political diasporas, and others. By focusing on a range of communities-in-motion and a diverse set of cultural texts, students explore the ways mobility, loss, and communal identity are conceptualized by immigrants, expatriates, refugees, guest-workers, religious seekers, and exiles. To this end, we read histories, ethnographies, essays, policy papers, novels, poetry, memoirs; we watch documentary and fictional films; we listen to music, speeches, spoken word performances, and prayers. Our aim is to deepen our understanding of the multiple meanings and conceptual limits of homeland and diaspora for Muslims in America, particularly in the Age of Terror.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Zareena Grewal'],['12435896'],[],['Th 1.30-3.20'],['HQ 113'],[],,,YC,Yale College,"['ER&M432', 'ANTH430', 'HIST123']",01,A,,Muslims in the United States,AMST,AMST430,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99246/assignments/syllabus,202403

That everyday environment is just as grounded in the past as it is in the present. Teachers, administrators, students, and parents are impacted by the racialized narratives about the past that groups and individuals take up to explain the bygone, justify the present, and to move them to action for the future. These individual and collective memories of who and where they are, and the traumas, successes, failures, and accomplishments that they have with regard to school and education are essential to understanding how schools and school reforms work.&#160;</p></p>
<p><p>Given the weight that narratives of social mobility in the United States place upon education, there is profound interest in the roles that schools play in perpetuating racial disparities in American society and the opportunities that education writ large might provide for remedying them.

A,205,American Exceptionalism,12147,AMST,"<p>This class takes a critical look at the ideology of American exceptionalism and the ways it is represented and reinforced in American popular culture, electoral politics, the U.S. corporate media, and various academic disciplines. This course pays special attention to how a study of slavery, settler colonialism, and U.S. imperialism challenges narratives of U.S. exceptionalism and innocence, as well as stories commonly told about freedom, emancipation, and racial progress. Students explore how the <em>1619 Project</em>, dinosaur paleontology, and the Broadway Musical <em>Hamilton </em>are rooted in ideologies of American exceptionalism and why Indigenous groups say Mount Rushmore, Thanksgiving, and native-themed sports mascots are celebrations of genocide. Students examine how claims that the U.S. is “redeemable” or that the country must “reckon with its shameful past” and “live up to its founding ideals” – or even fears that “our democracy is under threat” and that we’re “slipping toward fascism” – are deeply grounded in logics of exceptionalism and innocence.

Students draw on interdisciplinary approaches to the study of popular culture to explore how different kinds of media promote war as a form of “militainment” that ultimately serves to valorize troops, sanitize war, and glorify territorial conquest. Throughout the course, students also are introduced to pop culture representations of nuclear weapons, AI, and biological warfare; the prevalence of Islamophobia in the digital games industry; current debates around UFOs, alien abduction, and government coverup; and the ways professional sport teams like the Kansas City Chiefs reenact and celebrate the killing of Indigenous people for pleasure and entertainment – and how such native cultural appropriation fits into the larger historical context of the Indian wars and U.S. military violence.</p>",['YCSO'],0,['Roberto Sirvent'],['24885445'],[],['T 3.30-5.20'],['HQ 317'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,US Militarism & Pop Culture,AMST,AMST426,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99474/assignments/syllabus,202403

We examine manifestations of romantic love in medieval Arab cultures as precedents to the invention of courtly love.&#160;In the second part of our course, we turn to modern humanistic theories about romantic love. Among the questions that critical theorists and philosophers have posed, we consider: How is love related to desire? Is sexual desire an indispensable component of romantic love? Is romantic love ultimately a selfish, exclusionary act, or is it about renouncing the self, losing the self in the other?&#160;In the third part of our course, we apply the insights of parts 1 and 2 to discuss case studies of romantic love in the contemporary United States.

What might writers strive for, if not newness, rigor, excellence, or even one’s own voice?&#160;In this class, we defamiliarize and repair the habits of mind and body that have been normalized by the university. Some of our time goes toward identifying the racial and colonial logics as well as presumptions about gender and ability that inform the conventions, genres, and styles of scholarly prose. For example, we contemplate the power relations and tonal effects embedded in the familiar maneuvers of advancing and defending arguments. Most of the class’s energy, however, is devoted to testing out less combative modes of inhabiting the page. We pursue these experiments not in the name of novelty but with the hope that our compositional practices can move us toward different values and different futures for writing, conversing, and living as subjects of the university. To guide us in this endeavor, we look to scholars who have critiqued the politics of knowledge by mobilizing alternative styles of knowing. Some, for example, have turned footnotes into an occasion for giving thanks instead of exhibiting mastery.

The genre blossomed from its vernacular Southern roots during the twentieth century and grew in scope and popularity with the rise the recording industry in the United States. Populated by guitars and fiddles, heroes and outlaws, country music gave the world Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton and Carrie Underwood. Why have these artists achieved iconic status in America? What meaning can we cull about life in the United States from their musical legacies?&#160;This interdisciplinary course considers the major trends, influential artists, and varied influences affecting country music through time. More broadly, the genre is used as a vehicle for understanding shifting socio-cultural, political, and economic phenomena in the United States from 1927 to the present. The readings cover a broad range of issues and perspectives that have come to define country music historiography. Race, culture, commercialization, notions of authenticity, and the assertion proposed by country music’s senior authority, Bill C.

Our readings and discussions consider the extent to which the ""Asia"" that emerges in twentieth-century American literary and visual culture was a product of not only powerful (and often powerfully racist) Euro-American visions of Asian ""others,"" but also dialogic re-imaginations of Asia created by Asian-Americans themselves. Questions that the course addresses include: In what sense is ""Asia"" an aesthetic category in American literary and visual culture? What role does genre play in the circulation and recirculation of American images of Asia during the twentieth century? How do the political and economic demands of artistic production (for both literature and film) influence the type and heterogeneity of American images of Asia?</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR', 'YENJ']",0,[],[],[],[],[],[],,ENGL270,YC,Yale College,[],01,C,,Asian Culture in US Lit & Film,AMST,AMST270,,202403

This course unites the humanities fields of Asian American history and American Studies with the STEM fields of medicine, physics, and computer science to explore the ways in which scientific practice has been shaped by U.S. histories of imperialism and colonialism, migration and racial exclusion, domestic and international labor and economics, and war. The course also explores the scientific research undertaken in these fields and delves into key scientific principles and concepts to understand the impact of such work on the lives of Asians and Asian Americans, and how the migration of people may have impacted the migration of ideas and scientific progress. Using case students, students engage with fundamental scientific concepts in these fields. They explore key roles Asians and Asian Americans had in the development in science and technology in the United States and around the world as well as the impact of state policies regarding the migration of technical labor and the concerns over brain drains.

A,474,The Novel and the Nation: Reading India in Vikram Seth’s <i>A Suitable Boy</i>,12247,SAST,"<p>This course pairs two interconnected phenomena: the rise of the Indian Republic and the birth of the postcolonial novel. Over the course of the semester, we read a single primary text: Vikram Seth’s&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;(1993). Set in the 1950s in the aftermath of India’s Independence and Partition, Seth’s encyclopaedic novel is the story of four families brought together by a mother’s search for a “suitable boy” for her daughter to marry. In the process, it builds a microcosm of an Indian society coming to terms with postcolonial statehood and weighing the aftereffects of British colonialism. Entwined in its plot about marriage, love, and relationships are some of the most urgent cultural and political concerns facing the new nation: legislative changes and land reforms, the violent aftermath of the Partition, secularism tainted by communal tensions, the disintegration of courtly forms of sociality, the reconstruction of city life, and the fate of the English novel in the postcolonial classroom.&#160;We read&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;as literary critics and historians, pairing close readings of language and literary form with historical scholarship. Over the course of our discussions, we address the following questions: what is the relationship between the nation, the novel, and identity in the postcolonial world? How do we read narratives of “nation building” as literary and cultural constructions? What do we make of “literature” and “history” as disciplinary categories and formations?

By focusing on scientific societies, surveys, botany, medicine, and sanitation, the course first demonstrates how colonial rule viewed India as a field for experiments and also applying of scientific knowledge already established in Europe. We then examine how technological changes facilitated the colonial rule's aim of securing fiscal resources, connecting hinterlands to markets, ensuring relentless passage of information, and ensuring everyday surveillance. By exploring the histories of irrigation, railways, telegraph, electrification, and urban transportation, the lectures for this section demonstrate how the Empire governed through built networks. In exploring the modalities of colonial power, we note how it functioned by asserting that scientific enterprises and technological changes would 'improve' the condition of Indians, ensure their passage into 'civilization,' and consolidate their dwellings therein. However, we also observe that it denied that Indians would ever be civilized enough to utilize and build on these developments.

Linguistics is a science that addresses this puzzle for human language. Language is one of the most complex of human behaviors, but it comes to us without effort. Language is common to all societies and is typically acquired without explicit instruction. Human languages vary within highly specific parameters. The conventions of speech communities exhibit variation and change over time within the confines of universal grammar, part of our biological endowment. The properties of universal grammar are discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages and comparison across languages. This course introduces analytical methods that are used to understand this fundamental aspect of human knowledge. In this introductory course students learn about the principles that underly all human languages, and what makes language special.

Domestically, martial arts films have served to promote the nation, while on the international arena, they have been one of the primary conduits of transnational cinematic interaction, as kung-fu or samurai films have influenced films inside and outside East Asia, from&#160;<em>The Matrix</em>&#160;to&#160;<em>Kill Bill</em>. Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity. It is thus not surprising that martial arts films have also attracted some of the world’s best filmmakers, ranging from Kurosawa Akira to Wong Kar Wai. This course focuses on films from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea—as well as on works from other countries influenced by them—covering such martial arts genres such as the samurai film, kung-fu, karate, wuxia, and related historical epics.

How wide is the gap? How can we bridge it? How pervasive is the problem? This course introduces first-year students to writing in the discipline of philosophy by tracing the contours of these questions and exploring their answers in ancient China, ancient Greece, and modern analytic philosophy. We begin by considering the traditional account of weakness of will as akrasia (i.e., doing what one knows one shouldn’t do) and explaining how such a gap in our agency is or isn’t possible. Next, we consider an alternative account, that of acedia (i.e., not doing what one knows one should do), and assess strategies for helping an agent bridge this kind of gap. Finally, we reassess the phenomenon of weakness of will in light of arguments that position it in a broader context, approach it from a new perspective, or try to rewrite our understanding of the phenomenon altogether.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",0,['James Brown-Kinsella'],['24544714'],[],['TTh 1.00-2.15'],['HQ 123'],[],,PHIL100,YC,Yale College,"['EAST307', 'CLCV121']",01,A,,Writing Philosophy: Akrasia,EALL,EALL150,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99245/assignments/syllabus,202403

They discuss and interpret challenging themes such as racism, neoliberalism, and sexism from minority perspectives, starting from the first semester of Portuguese studies. Each unit concludes with a small project, integrating knowledge with other university courses. By the course end, students will have gained an understanding of the language across textual genres focusing on diverse aspects of Portuguese-speaking cultures. Students can also publish their work in our digital magazine, Revista dos Estudantes de Português da Yale.</p>",['YCL1'],50,"['Matheus Vilela', 'Ronaldo Omizolo de Souza']","['25514309', '25514292']",[],['M-F 10.30-11.20'],['WTS B62'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],05,A,,Elementary Portuguese I,PORT,PORT110,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/102933/assignments/syllabus,202403

In Walter Benjamin's much-discussed essay ""On the Critique of Violence"", Niobe's fate is a memorial to a mythical violence that has never been overcome. According to Benjamin, this violence today is linked to an instrumental approach to technology. In the seminar, we discuss media and technology philosophical approaches by Benjamin, Heidegger, Simondon, Haraway, Chude-Sokei, among others, but also texts by Kant, in order to explore the question of how we should understand the entanglement of melancholy, violence and an instrumental understanding of technology.

This course sets out to challenge our understanding of paper as a neutral or passive bearer of inscriptions by foregrounding its material quality. Our focus rests in equal parts on the media history of paper and paper works of art–among them many literary texts–that reflect or take advantage of their medium. Studying materials and histories from the early modern period to the present, we uncover paper’s status as a commodity bound up in a complex web of economic processes, as an instrument of political power, as a gendered and racialized object, and as a material that can be cut, shuffled, and even eaten. Ultimately, we investigate how paper is still central to our lives, even in the age of tablets and PDFs. Readings include Emily Dickinson’s envelope poems, Robert Walser’s “Microscripts,” and M.

A,426,Cinema of Crisis,14842,FILM,"<p>This course looks at European films dealing with various crises since 1945. The legacy of National Socialism, the rise of domestic and international terrorism (both before and after 9/11), the vast migrations of peoples, an increase in precarity, racism, and populism, the critique of capitalism, and the degradation of the environment—we examine these issues in films made after the end of World War II. Some of the questions that guide our inquiry are: When does violence seem like a legitimate answer to political, economic, and social pressures and the legacies of fascism and colonialism? Where and how do environmental issues come to the fore in an increasingly global Europe? How does cinema depict today’s multicultural societies in conflict? And how do gender issues inflect the precarious economic conditions shown in the films? Does the rise of digital technology inflect the way in which films portray history and memory? In directors’ varied aesthetic responses to death, displacement, and destruction, we find a growing consciousness of the social contradictions that lead to violence. This course seeks to define key words of cultural study such as public sphere, populism, precarity, neoliberalism, Anthropocene. It also seeks to give students insight into central concepts of film analysis (genre, spectatorship, point-of-view, audience, slow cinema). We take our case studies largely from Germany, Austria, France, and Italy.

A,160,The Question of Technology in Continental Theory,11073,HUMS,"<p>In Greek mythology, Niobe is the queen of Thebes and mother of six daughters and six sons. She rebelled against the gods and was severely punished for it: her children were killed and she herself was petrified in eternal mourning. In Walter Benjamin's much-discussed essay ""On the Critique of Violence"", Niobe's fate is a memorial to a mythical violence that has never been overcome. According to Benjamin, this violence today is linked to an instrumental approach to technology. In the seminar, we discuss media and technology philosophical approaches by Benjamin, Heidegger, Simondon, Haraway, Chude-Sokei, among others, but also texts by Kant, in order to explore the question of how we should understand the entanglement of melancholy, violence and an instrumental understanding of technology. Furthermore, we discuss how this link between violence, technology and melancholy can be resolved from the perspective of Benjamin's critique of violence.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Astrid Deuber-Mankowsky'],['25450729'],[],['W 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C05'],[],,GMAN205,YC,Yale College,"['FILM205', 'LITR244']",01,A,,Tech in Continental Theory,HUMS,HUMS160,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98463/assignments/syllabus,202403

Our focus rests in equal parts on the media history of paper and paper works of art–among them many literary texts–that reflect or take advantage of their medium. Studying materials and histories from the early modern period to the present, we uncover paper’s status as a commodity bound up in a complex web of economic processes, as an instrument of political power, as a gendered and racialized object, and as a material that can be cut, shuffled, and even eaten. Ultimately, we investigate how paper is still central to our lives, even in the age of tablets and PDFs. Readings include Emily Dickinson’s envelope poems, Robert Walser’s “Microscripts,” and M.

A,171,Politics of Performance,11642,HUMS,"<p>The stage is, and always has been, a political space. Ever since its beginnings, theatre has offered ways to rethink and criticize political systems, with the stage serving as a “moral institution” (Schiller) but also as a laboratory for models of representation. The stage also delineates the limits of representation for democratic societies (Rousseau), as it offers the space for experimentation and new modes of being together, being <em>ensemble</em>. The stage also raises the question of its own condition of possibility and the networks it depends on (Jackson).&#160;This course revisits the history of German and German speaking theatre since the Enlightenment, and discusses the stage in its relationship to war, the nation state, the social question, femicide and gender politics, the Holocaust, globalization, and 21st century migration.

Are there absolute standards of right conduct? Can we be sure that the world around us is actually real—and does that even matter?&#160;This course takes students on an expansive tour of the thought experiment genre, ranging across scientific and philosophical texts, films, and speculative fiction. As we explore what thought experiments are and how they work through contextualized close reading, we also consider broader questions: What does the thought experiment’s form tell us about how we come to know things? Is the thought experiment a clearly defined genre, and does it have a global history?

This course focuses on the intersections between aesthetics and ecological practices in the context of the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch wherein humans have become a major geological force shaping the planet. It challenges traditional approaches by examining how culture and the arts can help to understand and respond to environmental crises. Discussions and readings emphasize the role of culture and aesthetics as agents and producers of environmental knowledge, highlighting their potential to challenge socio-ecological relations. Throughout the semester, students explore various themes, including colonialism, anthropocentrism, human-animal relations, fossil capitalism, indigenous ontologies, and the impact of extractive industries on territories and bodies in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Latinx world. Students engage with works by established and emerging artists, aiming to produce ecocritical knowledge about the current climate and environmental crisis. The course also offers a panoramic view of Latin American culture by examining some key historical events and authors whose works can shed light on cultural and ideological processes at the root of climate change. By the end of the semester, students can formulate research questions that are critical to the field of Latin American environmental humanities, as well as produce papers that are relevant to a broader debate about culture and ecology. Lastly, the course hopes to motivate students—beyond the classroom—to examine their place in an increasingly warming world. <strong>Taught in Spanish.</strong></p>","['YCHU', 'YCL5']",50,['Santiago Acosta'],['25126811'],[],"['TTh 11.35-12.50', '1 HTBA HQ 123']","['HQ 123', '1 HTBA HQ 123']",[],,SPAN365,YC,Yale College,"['EVST266', 'LAST350']",01,A,,Ecologies of Culture,HUMS,HUMS452,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99569/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,186,War Games,12605,HUMS,"<p>Dismissed, mocked, feared or loved for decades, video games have become a staple of contemporary media, art, and popular culture, studied alongside traditional print media and film. They eclipse the global yearly revenue of both film and music industries combined, leaving their financial significance undeniable. What remains understudied, however, is the political and cultural significance of the medium. <em>War Games</em> is a seminar dedicated to the intersection of video games and political violence (both real and imaginary) in a global and particularly post-Cold War context.&#160;Students learn to recognize patterns of ideological communication in video games while developing close reading skills of literature and digital media alike. We combine the study of video games with broader inquires into the media that circulate through the game mediaverse, including literature, social and news media, and film. Playing games and reading books, we pose the following questions: How do players “perform” war in games, and how might they resist or subvert expected performances? How indeed are we as readers and players affected by the type of media we consume? What is an adaptation? How do adaptations influence or potentially reshape our relationships with the source material? What themes and ideas are revealed effectively through one medium versus another? Why do certain literary traditions (such as classical Russian literature) provide such fruitful ground for video game adaptation? What are the political implications for the ideologies present in a video game given the globalized position of the medium? Assigned readings include novels, short stories, news media, and internet forums alongside a range of secondary materials, including film and media theory, intellectual and media histories, digital anthropology, reception studies, and interviews.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Spencer Small'],['17251736'],[],"['W 7.00-8.00p', 'TTh 11.35-12.50']","['HQ C07', 'WLH 013']",[],,RUSS222,YC,Yale College,"['FILM369', 'RSEE244']",02,A,,War Games,HUMS,HUMS186,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99740/assignments/syllabus,202403

We will locate Crane as a queer American poet in his historical and cultural context in the early 20th&#160;century, writing alongside and against his Modernist contemporaries. We will also investigate Crane’s relationship to Romanticism by reading his poetry as a continuation and revision of Romantic precursors in both the English and American poetic traditions. Special attention will be paid to Crane’s unique poetics of catachresis, as evidenced through his poetry but also as articulated in his letters. Finally, we will consider the religious elements of Crane’s poetry and poetics by putting him conversation with hermeticism, Gnosticism, Biblical prophecy, and visionary experience.</p>","['YCHU', 'YENJ']",50,['Riley Soles'],['13756609'],[],"['W 1.30-3.20', '1 HTBA']","['WLH 014', '1 HTBA']",[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Hart Crane,HUMS,HUMS467,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99743/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,108,Introduction to the Occult Sciences,13185,RLST,"<p>This course provides a comparative history of the occult sciences from antiquity to the present. From Galen’s occult properties to Newton’s pursuit of alchemy, the notion that there are hidden forces in nature has played an immeasurable role in the development of religious thought, scientific reasoning, and literary endeavor. The modern impulse to separate religion from science and science from magic can obscure the centrality of an array of practices and beliefs across time and place. Far from a disenchanted present, magic and the occult are woven through the fabric of modernity. From healing crystals to the personalized astrology of Co-Star, tarot cards to New-Age inflected conspiracy theories, fortune tellers to countless films, we are surrounded by appeals to occult powers. Building on case studies from classical antiquity and Jewish, Christian, and Islamic letters, this course traces the development of the occult sciences through an array of historical periods, social contexts, and discursive materials. Topics include: origins of writing, astrology, alchemy, medicine, natural philosophy, divination, automata, talismans, natural magic, letterism, hermeticism, kabbalah, Neoplatonism, recipes for summoning demons and angels, persecution, orientalism, colonialism, mesmerism, spiritualism, disenchantment, modernity, capitalism, consumption, and fantasy. Materials are drawn from an array of sources, including: philosophical dialogues, scientific manuals, illuminated manuscripts, encyclopedias, cosmographies, handbooks of practical magic, collections of stories, and movies. In addition to a panoply of primary sources and contemporary scholarship on theory and method, students are introduced to a variety of archival materials in the Yale collections.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Travis Zadeh'],['17106828'],[],['TTh 10.30-11.20'],['HQ L02'],[],,RLST108,YC,Yale College,['HSHM451'],01,A,,Intro to the Occult Sciences,HUMS,HUMS108,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100133/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,422,Early Film Theory and Modernity,13373,HUMS,"<p>For a long time, early film theory and criticism have been overlooked and underestimated. However, their recent rediscovery has highlighted their crucial role in framing film as a ""modern"" invention. While discussing what then was a recent invention, early film theory and criticism tackled some of the main characteristic of modern life: speed, excitation, contingency, openness, subjectivity, circulation, etc. By doing so, they underscored the parallel between modern experience and filmic representations. On the screen –they claimed– spectators do not only see the world in which they live, but also the effects of the political, industrial, and social revolutions on this world. At the same time, early film theory and criticism developed an ideal of “modern” art and “modern” language, through a systematic exploration of filmic style and iconography. According to them, film was the epitome of a “new art” for “new times.” The course explores the idea of modernity as it developed in the Western world between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. Despite this limitation, we do not meet a uniform landscape; on the contrary, ideological differences and national identities played a major role in defining the perspectives forged by film theorists and critics. While considering texts from France (Delluc, Epstein), Germany (Arnheim, Kracauer), Middle-Europe (Bálazs, Lukács, Tille), Italy (Papini, Thovez), Soviet Union (Eisenstein, Vertov, Pudovkin) and USA (Lindsay, Freeburg, Münsterberg), the course systematically and critically compares them and their traditions.

We address these questions in a global sense as much as we can: while the culture of Western modernity will figure very prominently in the readings and discussion, we take a more enlarged perspective, with some of the readings being about, and/or from, places and imaginaries beyond the West: China, Afrofuturism, and South Asia. Readings consist mostly of imaginative literary works (short stories, and excerpts from longer novels), but also encompasses some non-fiction and graphic fiction. At least two weeks of class also focuses on non-textual culture (theater, film, paintings, and music that is connected to AI).

It aims to produce and disseminate knowledge, and to prepare graduates for work in all different kinds of fields. It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective.

With the use of secondary works and primary sources, students gain some familiarity with the queens themselves, their struggles to use and retain power, and the cultures in which those queens were embedded. Over the duration of the course, students form a basic idea of what queenship has entailed across cultures, while simultaneously discovering how queenship varied in different cultures and material circumstances. The course thereby not only investigates queenship, but also serves as an introduction to the temporal, spatial, and conceptual breadth of world history. And, through watching recent film and television depictions of these queens, students come to grips with the problem of historical memory and the uses (or abuses) to which history can be put.<br /></p>

We discuss and close read a variety of texts, which are representative of different strategies for reflecting on the self and on the ‘other’ by unpacking the unstable relationship between anthropomorphism, personification, and humanization.

A,387,Introduction to Digital Humanities I: Architectures of Knowledge,15683,HUMS,"<p>The cultural record of humanity is undergoing a massive and epochal transformation into shared analog and digital realities. While we are vaguely familiar with the history and realities of the analog record—libraries, archives, historical artifacts—the digital cultural record remains largely unexamined and relatively mysterious to humanities scholars. In this course you will be introduced to the broad field of Digital Humanities, theory and practice, through a stepwise exploration of the new architectures and genres of scholarly and humanistic production and reproduction in the 21st century. The course combines a seminar, preceded by a brief lecture, and a digital studio. Every week we will move through our discussions in tandem with hands-on exercises that will serve to illuminate our readings and help you gain a measure of computational proficiency useful in humanities scholarship. You will learn about the basics of plain text, file and operating systems, data structures and internet infrastructure. You will also learn to understand, produce and evaluate a few popular genres of Digital Humanities, including, digital editions of literary or historical texts, collections and exhibits of primary sources and interactive maps. Finally, and perhaps the most important lesson of the semester, you will learn to collaborate with each other on a common research project.

Is it a political idea, or is it a philosophy that tries to carve out a space apart from high politics? Is it about rights, or about equality?

Can we even define what liberalism means, or does the attempt to do so in some way even miss the point?&#160;This class is a historical, philosophical, and political examination of one of the most important and contested ideas in the modern world. We read both critics and advocates of liberalism. We also examine it historically, sociologically, and comparatively, in order to gain a better sense of what it means in practice, and how it differs from the arguments of both its most strong supporters and defenders, and its critics.

This course explores a selection of such interior journeys as described by six individuals across six centuries and four continents: Augustine of Hippo (Africa, 4th-5th century), Teresa of Avila (Europe, 16th century), Frederick Douglass (North America, 19th century), Black Elk (North America, 19th-20th centuries), Mahatma Gandhi (Asia, 19th-20th centuries), and Etty Hillesum (Europe, 20th century). Whether in the form of an educational awakening, a profound religious conversion, a growing consciousness of a social or political mission, or some combination thereof, these human beings share their inmost joys and struggles—for freedom, understanding, justice, and love—in ways that can inspire each of us to undertake and reflect on our own interior journeys.&#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",50,['Rosalie Stoner'],['24910350'],[],"['MW 2.30-3.45', 'F 1.00-4.00']","['HQ C11', '']",[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Enrollment is limited to first-year students.&#160;</p>",,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,SixPrettyGoodInteriorJourneys,HUMS,HUMS017,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/102721/assignments/syllabus,202403

The class features a combination of “messy” informal writing-to-learn practices and exercises, as well as two polished formal assignments.

What remains understudied, however, is the political and cultural significance of the medium. <em>War Games</em> is a seminar dedicated to the intersection of video games and political violence (both real and imaginary) in a global and particularly post-Cold War context.&#160;Students learn to recognize patterns of ideological communication in video games while developing close reading skills of literature and digital media alike. We combine the study of video games with broader inquires into the media that circulate through the game mediaverse, including literature, social and news media, and film. Playing games and reading books, we pose the following questions: How do players “perform” war in games, and how might they resist or subvert expected performances? How indeed are we as readers and players affected by the type of media we consume? What is an adaptation? How do adaptations influence or potentially reshape our relationships with the source material? What themes and ideas are revealed effectively through one medium versus another? Why do certain literary traditions (such as classical Russian literature) provide such fruitful ground for video game adaptation? What are the political implications for the ideologies present in a video game given the globalized position of the medium?

A,175,North Korea and Religion,10686,RLST,"<p>Ever since the establishment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 1948 and the Korean War (1950–1953), North Korea has been depicted by the media as a reclusive, oppressive, and military country, its leaders as the worst dictators, and its people as brainwashed, tortured, and starving to death. The still ongoing Cold War discourse, intensified by the North Korea’s recent secret nuclear weapons program, furthers these negative images, and outsiders have passively internalized these images.&#160;However, these simplistic characterizations prevent one from gaining a balanced understanding of and insight into North Korea and its people on the ground. Topics other than political, military, and security issues are rarely given attention. On the whole, even though North Korea’s land area is larger than South Korea and its population of 25 million accounts for a third of all Koreans, North Korea has been neglected in the scholarly discussion of Korean culture.&#160;This class tries to make sense of North Korea in a more comprehensive way by integrating the political and economic with social, cultural, and religious dimensions. In order to accomplish this objective, students examine leadership, religious (especially cultic) aspects of the North Korean Juche ideology, the daily lives of its citizens, religious traditions, the Korean War, nuclear development and missiles, North Korean defectors and refugees, human rights, Christian missionary organizations, and unification, among others. Throughout, the course&#160;places North Korean issues in the East Asian and global context.

We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia.

Rather than starting with the categories of Western philosophy, we seek to develop an account that emerges from Buddhist sources. We begin by establishing a working model of karmic acts—describing the status of agents and patients, the mechanics of karma, and the cosmological and soteriological contexts for action. We then examine the paradigmatic ethical act of giving as embodied by two great virtuous exemplars: the Buddha (archetypal renunciate) and Vessantara (archetypal layman). From there, we turn to case studies of ethical cultivation and negotiation in three realms of Buddhist practice: the Vinaya precepts governing monastic life, the altruism and skillful means of bodhisattvas, and the antinomian ethics of Buddhist tantra.

A,108,Introduction to the Occult Sciences,13183,RLST,"<p>This course provides a comparative history of the occult sciences from antiquity to the present. From Galen’s occult properties to Newton’s pursuit of alchemy, the notion that there are hidden forces in nature has played an immeasurable role in the development of religious thought, scientific reasoning, and literary endeavor. The modern impulse to separate religion from science and science from magic can obscure the centrality of an array of practices and beliefs across time and place. Far from a disenchanted present, magic and the occult are woven through the fabric of modernity. From healing crystals to the personalized astrology of Co-Star, tarot cards to New-Age inflected conspiracy theories, fortune tellers to countless films, we are surrounded by appeals to occult powers. Building on case studies from classical antiquity and Jewish, Christian, and Islamic letters, this course traces the development of the occult sciences through an array of historical periods, social contexts, and discursive materials. Topics include: origins of writing, astrology, alchemy, medicine, natural philosophy, divination, automata, talismans, natural magic, letterism, hermeticism, kabbalah, Neoplatonism, recipes for summoning demons and angels, persecution, orientalism, colonialism, mesmerism, spiritualism, disenchantment, modernity, capitalism, consumption, and fantasy. Materials are drawn from an array of sources, including: philosophical dialogues, scientific manuals, illuminated manuscripts, encyclopedias, cosmographies, handbooks of practical magic, collections of stories, and movies.

C,259,Muslim Societies in Africa,14698,RLST,"<p>While the Western academy has long devoted attention to Africa and Islam, it has not commonly treated the two together.

Indeed, today Africans constitute nearly a third of the global Muslim community. Islam enjoys a rich history on the continent, stretching from the migration of Muslims to seventh-century Abyssinia to the Islamic kingdoms of nineteenth-century West Africa. This course seeks to reimagine Africa not as a periphery but as a center of the Islamic World. It relocates a model of Islam that looks to the Middle East, instead highlighting the diversity of practice, scholarship, and politics of Muslim societies in Africa. It explores how constructions of race inform the representation of Islam in Africa today. It also questions whether one can even speak of Islam <em>in</em> Africa at all, reexamining what is lost and what is gained in such a geography of African and Muslim subjects.&#160;Rather than a comprehensive overview, the course provides a solid foundation for engaging in key theoretical debates on issues of religion, race, and politics in Africa and the wider Islamic World.</p>",['YCHU'],0,[],[],[],[],[],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,C,,Muslim Societies in Africa,RLST,RLST259,,202403
A,209,"Religion, Ethnicity, and Nationalism in Southeast Asia",14858,RLST,"<p>Religion, ethnicity, and nationalism are three of the most potent forces that have shaped contemporary Southeast Asia. This course is intended to provide context and a foundation for understanding the theory of nationalism and religious perspectives on everyday politics, including ethnicity, nation-imagination, minority-majority identity conflict, conflict among ethnic minorities, militarism, and tribalism. Drawing on case studies from across the region, we will critically examine why and how religion serves as a source of ethnic conflict and exclusion, as well as a potential source of conflict resolution&#160;and embrace. In doing so, we will also fill in some gaps by examining nuanced approaches toward religious doctrines related to community, human rights, and human identity, as well as the lived experiences of both public and hidden resistance to ethnic domination. Looking at these religious dynamics in Southeast Asia can also be applied to similar ethnic conflicts elsewhere in the world, including in the US.</p>","['YCSO', 'YCWR']",50,['David Moe'],['24900388'],[],['T 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C64'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],02,A,,REL & Nationalism in SE Asia,RLST,RLST209,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100937/assignments/syllabus,202403

Have you ever wondered what makes this tiny city so beloved to—and the object of continual strife for—Jews, Christians, and Muslims? Through engagement with a wide range of sources—including biblical lamentations, archeological excavations, qur’anic passages, exegetical materials, medieval pilgrim itineraries, legal documents, maps, poetry, art, architecture, and international political resolutions—students develop the historiographical tools and theoretical frameworks to study the history of one of the world’s most enduringly important and bitterly contested cities.&#160; Students encounter persistent themes central to the identity of Jerusalem: geography and topography; exile, diaspora, and return; destruction and trauma; religious violence and war; practices of pilgrimage; social diversity; missionizing; the rise of nationalism; peace efforts; the ethics of storytelling; and the stakes of studying the past.</p>","['PREI', 'YCHU']",50,['Sarit Kattan Gribetz'],['11375844'],[],['MW 2.30-3.45'],['HQ C07'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Enrollment limited to first-year students.&#160;</p>",,YC,Yale College,"['JDST035', 'HIST023', 'HUMS036']",01,A,,Jerusalem,RLST,RLST035,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/101109/assignments/syllabus,202403
A,293,Reform and Continuity in Islamic law,16313,RLST,"<p>This course aims to provide students with an alternative reading of the Islamic legal tradition. It upends the view that Islamic law was in some way allergic to change. Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence (<em>fiqh</em>), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God’s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions (<em>fatwā</em>s) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course challenges students to ask what is change within a tradition? In the debates and polemics of legal scholars, we contemplate the appeal and the limitations of reform within Islamic law, tracing how both have been contested and have evolved across different geographies and periods in the Muslim World. Likewise, we rethink the boundaries of continuity. We question how a legal school and a legal canon are constructed and revised, examining the ways in which both are capable of reinforcing – or imperiling – the Islamic legal tradition. Last, we explore the endurance of Islamic law in contemporary Muslim societies. The course reflects on the processes and the consequences of various projects of “modernizing” the Sharīʿa, asking how the institutions of the colonial and postcolonial state have reconfigured Islamic law in radically different ways.&#160;</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Matthew Steele'],['25232143'],[],['W 3.30-5.20'],['WLH 203'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Islamic law,RLST,RLST293,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/102797/assignments/syllabus,202403

Religious activities can occur in churches or mosques, forests or mountains, community centers, public squares, or homes. The course materials consider specific religious sites and contexts, examining how these places simultaneously become sites of worship, articulations of identity and heritage, claims of political significance, and hubs of social and emotional life.

We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France.

A,337,Feminism without Women: Modernist and Postcolonial Textual Experiments,11088,ITAL,"<p>Antifeminist critics charge the feminist movement with having forgotten “real women'' in favor of inaccessible theories rejecting the supposedly incontrovertible fact that there are only two sexes and genders. This seminar turns the charge on its head by exploring a theoretical and literary canon that - by questioning the ontological status of the male/female binary - has transformed feminism into a capacious, radically inclusive, revolutionary 21st Century movement. The texts and the theories that we discuss put pressure on the very category of “woman” as they strive to rethink feminism as a non-identitarian world-making project. The class focuses on two movements that employ art and literature to push back against the idea of “women” as the monolithic subject of feminism: Italian vanguard modernism and Italophone literary postcolonialism. We discuss modernist and postcolonial novels, poems, essays, and performative art pieces together with classics of feminist, queer and postcolonial theory. We push our own political imagination further by asking ever more sophisticated questions about gender, sexuality, ethnicity, race, and the way these intersecting social formations mediate the way we see, experience, and represent our material and social reality.

A,020,Six Pretty Good Dogs,14637,ITAL,"<p>We all have heard the phrase “Dogs are man’s best friends.” For thousands and thousands of years there has been an indissoluble friendship between man and dog, an unwritten covenant, a symbiotic relationship that has no equal in the animal world. Why do we consider them our ‘best friends’? And is this always true? If not, why do we sometimes fear dogs? What role have dogs played in our understanding of being human? This course explores images of dogs in 20th-21st Italian literature through six main categories: a man and his dog; dogs and inhumanity; dogs and exile; dogs and children; dogs and folktales; dogs and modern bestiary. We discuss and close read a variety of texts, which are representative of different strategies for reflecting on the self and on the ‘other’ by unpacking the unstable relationship between anthropomorphism, personification, and humanization. Hopefully, these texts impel us to understand how profoundly the animal is involved in the human and the human in the animal.&#160;This course is part of the ""Six Pretty Good Ideas"" program.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",50,['Simona Lorenzini'],['13162680'],[],['MW 4.00-5.15'],['HQ C07'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Enrollment limited to first-year students.&#160;</p>

Modern Italian SF combines an often ironic and whimsical tone with narratives that explore projected technological advancements, representations of the posthuman, and themes of apocalypse and dystopia. Reflecting also on the ideological norms of the particular era, Italian SF dissects various aspects of contemporary social life through the defamiliarization typical of the genre. We consider both historical and theoretical aspects of Italian SF, discussing questions of genre (and its intersections with the fantastic), as well as gender representation, particularly with respect to the current philosophical discussions on the post-human.

A,431,North Korea and Religion,10693,EAST,"<p>Ever since the establishment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 1948 and the Korean War (1950–1953), North Korea has been depicted by the media as a reclusive, oppressive, and military country, its leaders as the worst dictators, and its people as brainwashed, tortured, and starving to death. The still ongoing Cold War discourse, intensified by the North Korea’s recent secret nuclear weapons program, furthers these negative images, and outsiders have passively internalized these images.&#160;However, these simplistic characterizations prevent one from gaining a balanced understanding of and insight into North Korea and its people on the ground. Topics other than political, military, and security issues are rarely given attention. On the whole, even though North Korea’s land area is larger than South Korea and its population of 25 million accounts for a third of all Koreans, North Korea has been neglected in the scholarly discussion of Korean culture.&#160;This class tries to make sense of North Korea in a more comprehensive way by integrating the political and economic with social, cultural, and religious dimensions. In order to accomplish this objective, students examine leadership, religious (especially cultic) aspects of the North Korean Juche ideology, the daily lives of its citizens, religious traditions, the Korean War, nuclear development and missiles, North Korean defectors and refugees, human rights, Christian missionary organizations, and unification, among others. Throughout, the course&#160;places North Korean issues in the East Asian and global context.

A,313,Contemporary Japan and the Ghosts of Modernity,10961,EAST,"<p>This course introduces students to contemporary Japan, examining how its defeat in the Second World War and loss of empire in 1945 continue to shape Japanese culture and society. Looking especially at the sphere of cultural production, it focuses on the question of what it means to be modern as expressed through the tension between resurgent neonationalism and the aspiration to internationalize. The course charts how the legacy of Japan’s imperial failure plays a significant role in its search for renewal and identity since 1945. How, it asks, does the experience of catastrophic failure—and failure to account for that failure—play into continued aspirations for modernity today? How does Japanese society wrestle with modernity’s two faces: its promise for progress and its history of catastrophic violence? The course follows the trajectory of Japan’s postwar nation-state development after the dissolution of empire, from its resurrection out of the ashes after defeat, to its identity as a US ally and economic superpower during the Cold War, to decades of recession since the 1990s and the search for new relations with its neighbors and new reckonings with its own imperial violence and postwar inactions against the background of rising neonationalism.</p>","['YANS', 'YCHU', 'YCSO']",0,['Yukiko Koga'],['24306272'],[],['W 3.30-5.20'],['WTS A74'],[],,ANTH213,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Contemporary Japan,EAST,EAST313,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98167/assignments/syllabus,202403

This course explores this politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. The class asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the US, this course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCSO']",0,['Yukiko Koga'],['24306272'],[],['T 1.30-3.20'],['SA10 105'],[],,ANTH824,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Politics of Memory,EAST,EAST324,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98188/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,260,East Asian Martial Arts Film,11364,EAST,"<p>The martial arts film has not only been a central genre for many East Asian cinemas, it has been the cinematic form that has most defined those cinemas for others. Domestically, martial arts films have served to promote the nation, while on the international arena, they have been one of the primary conduits of transnational cinematic interaction, as kung-fu or samurai films have influenced films inside and outside East Asia, from&#160;<em>The Matrix</em>&#160;to&#160;<em>Kill Bill</em>. Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity. It is thus not surprising that martial arts films have also attracted some of the world’s best filmmakers, ranging from Kurosawa Akira to Wong Kar Wai.

In particular, we ask if these can be done without detailed knowledge of local context, culture and history, and study how these sources relate to recent ethnographic knowledge about people's lives in rural southern Xinjiang.

A,307,"Writing Philosophy: Weakness of Will in Ancient China, Greece, and Today",11770,PHIL,"<p>“Grant me chastity and strength of will—but not yet!” In this infamous prayer, Augustine wrestles with a perennial problem for human agency: the apparent gap between knowing that we should do something and actually wanting to do it. How wide is the gap? How can we bridge it? How pervasive is the problem? This course introduces first-year students to writing in the discipline of philosophy by tracing the contours of these questions and exploring their answers in ancient China, ancient Greece, and modern analytic philosophy. We begin by considering the traditional account of weakness of will as akrasia (i.e., doing what one knows one shouldn’t do) and explaining how such a gap in our agency is or isn’t possible. Next, we consider an alternative account, that of acedia (i.e., not doing what one knows one should do), and assess strategies for helping an agent bridge this kind of gap. Finally, we reassess the phenomenon of weakness of will in light of arguments that position it in a broader context, approach it from a new perspective, or try to rewrite our understanding of the phenomenon altogether.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",0,['James Brown-Kinsella'],['24544714'],[],['TTh 1.00-2.15'],['HQ 123'],[],,PHIL100,YC,Yale College,"['EALL150', 'CLCV121']",01,A,,Writing Philosophy: Akrasia,EAST,EAST307,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99245/assignments/syllabus,202403

We then examine the paradigmatic ethical act of giving as embodied by two great virtuous exemplars: the Buddha (archetypal renunciate) and Vessantara (archetypal layman). From there, we turn to case studies of ethical cultivation and negotiation in three realms of Buddhist practice: the Vinaya precepts governing monastic life, the altruism and skillful means of bodhisattvas, and the antinomian ethics of Buddhist tantra.

A,253,Japanese Literature after 1970,14877,EAST,"<p>This course is an introduction to Japanese literature written in the last fifty years, with a focus on women writers. We read poetry and prose featuring mothers, daughters, and lovers, novels that follow convenience and thrift store workers, and poetry about factory girls. Our reading takes us from the daily grind of contemporary Tokyo to dystopian futures, from 1970s suburbia to surreal dreamscapes. We attend carefully to the ways in which different writers craft their works and, in particular, to their representation of feelings and affects. Whether the dull ache of loneliness, the oppression of boredom or the heavy weight of fatigue, it is often something about the mood of a work–rather than its narrative–that leaves a distinct impression. We develop the tools to analyze and discuss this sense of distinctness, as well as discover ways to stage connections and comparisons between the works we read.&#160;</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Paul McQuade'],['25463394'],[],['TTh 11.35-12.50'],['HQ 127'],[],,EALL265,YC,Yale College,"['LITR251', 'EAST553']",01,A,,Japanese Literature after 1970,EAST,EAST253,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100946/assignments/syllabus,202403

This course explores the Korean film history and aesthetics from its colonial days (1910-1945) to the hallyu era (2001-present), and also analyzes several key texts that are critical for understanding this field of study. How is Korean cinema shaped by (re)interpretations of history and society? How do we understand Korean cinema vis-à-vis the public memories of the Korean War, industrialization, social movements, economic development, and globalization? And how do aesthetics and storytelling in Korean cinema contribute to its popularity among local spectators and to its globality in shaping the contours of world cinema? By deeply inquiring into such questions, students learn how to critically view, think about, and write about film. Primary texts include literature and film. All films are screened with English subtitles.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Tian Li'],['24898773'],[],"['M 3.30-5.20', 'M 6.00-9.00p']",['HQ 129'],[],,FILM342,YC,Yale College,['EALL297'],01,A,,Global Korean Cinema,EAST,EAST300,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/101097/assignments/syllabus,202403

We examine the way in which writers and artists struggled with these issues in five media: memoir, theology, history, fiction, and painting, thereby creating Jewish versions first of Enlightenment, Romanticism, and realism (1780-1870) and then of nationalism, positivism, and modernism (1870-1930). &#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",37,['David Sorkin'],['15300821'],[],['MW 2.30-3.20'],['HQ 133'],[],,,YC,Yale College,['JDST346'],01,A,,Making European Culture Jewish,HIST,HIST249,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98384/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,396J,Revolutions and Socialist Experiments in Africa,10351,HIST,"<p>This seminar explores the contours of Africa’s embrace and engagement with the most influential ideology of the twentieth-century. Why, and through which channels, were Africans attracted to socialism? Did particular forms of colonialism and decolonization push African political actors towards revolution and socialist experiments? Is it legitimate, as some scholars have suggested, to speak of genuinely African socialisms? If so, what was the nature of these socialisms and how did they differ from the versions of socialism around the world? What political, social, economic, and cultural ends did socialism serve in Africa? And what were the consequences and legacies of African socialist experiments? The seminar addresses these questions. Our goal is to place Africa in the mainstream of conversations about socialism. We begin with the assumption that, like any doctrine, socialism was the object of multiple interpretations, modification, and appropriation from its inception. In so doing, we challenge orthodox understandings of socialism, which hold the European versions as the pure models and the rest as diluted if not populist façades of the ‘true’ doctrine.&#160;We begin with theoretical readings that help us situate the major debates about socialism in general and socialism in Africa. We then proceed to examine the overall historical context in which African nationalists adopted socialism. We differentiate the first branch of “African Socialism” from the second wave of “Afro-Marxism.” We also pay close attention to issues of decolonization and political imagination; ideas and experiments of development; gender, morality, and social engineering.&#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",0,['Benedito Machava'],['24306255'],[],['T 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C15'],[],,,YC,Yale College,['AFST396'],01,A,,African Socialist Experiments,HIST,HIST396J,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98436/assignments/syllabus,202403

C,122J,Capitalism and Inequality,11288,HIST,"<p>Rising inequality is widely recognized as one of the biggest challenges of our time. Over several centuries, capitalism has generated considerable increases in standards of living all over the world and has allowed humans to cultivate their potential in unprecedented ways. But the dynamism that came with capitalist development also created instability and risks. Many societies eventually put in place welfare systems that shielded individuals from the worst vagaries of economic life. Democracy and capitalism could thus coexist. In recent decades, this fragile coexistence has frayed, leading to the rise of populism and extremist right-wing politics. Inequality is seen as a major contributor to such backsliding. This course looks at the history of inequality to understand how we got to where we are in the present moment. The course is divided into two parts: (1) a survey of past forms of inequality and importantly, how societies explained and justified the existence of often pronounced inequality, and (2) what sustains inequality in America today: inequalities of income, banking and money, housing, health, education, opportunity, among others. Readings on these topics allow us to trace back the history of such issues as well as contemporary expressions of the same problem.

We proceed in a roughly chronological fashion, beginning with the arrival of Protestant missionaries on the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean in the early 19th century and concluding with the ongoing Gaza war. To what extent have American and Middle Eastern perceptions of each other evolved in the intervening two hundred years? What has the Middle East meant to Americans, and what has America meant to Middle Eastern populations? Was the relationship between them always destined to be fraught with misunderstanding and antagonism, or were there missed opportunities for alternative futures? If so, are those alternatives still viable today? By juxtaposing American and Middle Eastern perspectives and mining the contested space between them, students weigh answers to these and other historical and historiographical questions throughout the semester.

Medieval Jewish history was written prominently through written sources, and hence tended to concentrate on the intellectual male elite, institutions and events. Following the ‘material turn’, this seminar wishes to use Jewish material culture in order to portray the everyday life of ordinary people. Among the subjects we will touch upon are: space, language, economics, the Jewish quarter and street; the synagogue; the ritual bath (mikve); the cemetery and gravestones; book culture; charters; jewelry; fashion and food.</p>",['YCHU'],50,[],[],[],[],[],[],,JDST372,YC,Yale College,[],02,C,,Jewish EveryDayLifeMiddleAges,HIST,HIST230J,,202403

Few parts of the world are more politically and ecologically diverse. In the twenty-first century, Southeast Asia is one of the most economically vibrant regions of the world, but growth has come with rising inequality. Southeast Asian societies are the front line in feeling the impact of climate change, and Southeast Asian waters are a frontier of geopolitical rivalry. Beginning with a glimpse into ancient Southeast Asia, the class focuses on the early modern and modern eras, with plenty of coverage of the recent past. Key underlying themes include the importance of migration, and the role of the environment—and especially of water—in shaping modern Southeast Asia. Throughout the class, we turn to literary, film, and visual sources to enhance our understanding of cultural change. By the end of the course, students have a broad understanding of modern Southeast Asian societies and politics. They are also able to discern how Southeast Asia’s historical experience offers insights and inspiration in relation to universal challenges—how to live with cultural differences, for instance, or how to adapt to rapid environmental change.</p>",['YCHU'],23,['Sunil Amrith'],['24279888'],[],['TTh 10.30-11.20'],['WLH 116'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,History of Southeast Asia,HIST,HIST308,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99235/assignments/syllabus,202403
A,123,Muslims in the United States,11783,HIST,"<p>Since 9/11, cases of what has been termed “home-grown terrorism” have cemented the fear that “bad” Islam is not just something that exists far away, in distant lands. As a result, there has been an urgent interest to understand who American Muslims are by officials, experts, journalists, and the public. Although Muslims have been part of America’s story from its founding, Muslims have alternated from an invisible minority to the source of national moral panics, capturing national attention during political crises, as a cultural threat or even a potential fifth column. Today the stakes are high to understand what kinds of meanings and attachments connect Muslims in America to the Muslim world and to the US as a nation.&#160;Over the course of the semester, students grapple with how to define and apply the slippery concept of diaspora to different dispersed Muslim populations in the US, including racial and ethnic diasporas, trading diasporas, political diasporas, and others. By focusing on a range of communities-in-motion and a diverse set of cultural texts, students explore the ways mobility, loss, and communal identity are conceptualized by immigrants, expatriates, refugees, guest-workers, religious seekers, and exiles. To this end, we read histories, ethnographies, essays, policy papers, novels, poetry, memoirs; we watch documentary and fictional films; we listen to music, speeches, spoken word performances, and prayers. Our aim is to deepen our understanding of the multiple meanings and conceptual limits of homeland and diaspora for Muslims in America, particularly in the Age of Terror.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Zareena Grewal'],['12435896'],[],['Th 1.30-3.20'],['HQ 113'],[],,AMST430,YC,Yale College,"['ER&M432', 'ANTH430']",01,A,,Muslims in the United States,HIST,HIST123,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99246/assignments/syllabus,202403

The course examines and conceptualizes how the Middle East <em>figured</em> in European imperial projects in the Western Hemisphere. It starts with the Papal sanction of Spanish and Portuguese colonial projects in the Americas as a continuation of their expulsion of the Moors from Iberia and proceeds to examine the histories of enslaved Black Muslims. A visit to the Beinecke Library and the Yale Archives to examine Ezra Stiles’ collection of Hebrew and Arabic texts and the ‘moorish’ identity of the boy he enslaved brings our inquiry closer to home. Additional visits to the archives of American missionary societies active in the Middle East, which are housed at the Yale Divinity School, invites students to examine primary sources linking Yale and New Haven to the Middle East. Our class ends in 1887 with Frederick Douglass’ visit to Egypt and the concurrent histories of officers in the US Confederacy who served in the Egyptian military. By examining how the Middle East came to appear in European imperial projects in the Americas, we can more critically understand how American and European colonizers, missionaries, and travelers came to appear in the Middle East.&#160;Topics include toleration and violence, women and gender, settler colonialism, slavery, ecological and climatic changes, and the birth of financial capitalism.

A,341J,The Novel and the Nation: Reading India in Vikram Seth’s <i>A Suitable Boy</i>,12246,HIST,"<p>This course pairs two interconnected phenomena: the rise of the Indian Republic and the birth of the postcolonial novel. Over the course of the semester, we read a single primary text: Vikram Seth’s&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;(1993). Set in the 1950s in the aftermath of India’s Independence and Partition, Seth’s encyclopaedic novel is the story of four families brought together by a mother’s search for a “suitable boy” for her daughter to marry. In the process, it builds a microcosm of an Indian society coming to terms with postcolonial statehood and weighing the aftereffects of British colonialism. Entwined in its plot about marriage, love, and relationships are some of the most urgent cultural and political concerns facing the new nation: legislative changes and land reforms, the violent aftermath of the Partition, secularism tainted by communal tensions, the disintegration of courtly forms of sociality, the reconstruction of city life, and the fate of the English novel in the postcolonial classroom.&#160;We read&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;as literary critics and historians, pairing close readings of language and literary form with historical scholarship. Over the course of our discussions, we address the following questions: what is the relationship between the nation, the novel, and identity in the postcolonial world? How do we read narratives of “nation building” as literary and cultural constructions? What do we make of “literature” and “history” as disciplinary categories and formations? The seminar introduces students to methods of literary criticism and textual studies, and teaches them how to read a range of primary sources, from legislative debates, bureaucratic reports, newspapers, poetry, cinema, and radio.</p>","['YCHU', 'YENS']",0,"['Priyasha Mukhopadhyay', 'Rohit De']","['17597108', '12160377']",[],['M 1.30-3.20'],['LC 104'],[],,ENGL368,YC,Yale College,['SAST474'],01,A,,Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy,HIST,HIST341J,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99480/assignments/syllabus,202403

It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective.

Through a close reading of primary and secondary sources, students examine the ways apartheid and anti-apartheid shaped the second half of the 20th century in South Africa and the United States. We grapple with a range of questions, including how transnational connections reveal new perspectives on systems of oppression and resistance in both the United States and South Africa. How did the Cold War and decolonization shape the anti-apartheid movement and African liberation movements? How did ordinary South Africans challenge apartheid? How did the U.S.-based anti-apartheid movement influence official state policy towards South Africa? Since this history is very recent, the legacies of apartheid and the transition to majority rule in 1994 are contested and continue to shape South Africa today. South Africa remains one of the most unequal nations in the world, and faces many compounding crises, including water and electricity shortages, a catastrophically high crime rate, an unrelenting AIDS crisis, and ever-rising unemployment.

A,228,Borders & Globalization in Hispanophone Cultures,11335,SP&P,"<p class=""p1"">The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives.&#160;Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization?&#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YCL5']",50,['Luna Najera'],['24174403'],[],['TTh 11.35-12.50'],['HQ 133'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Prerequisite: SPAN 140 or 145, or in accordance with placement results.</p>

It challenges traditional approaches by examining how culture and the arts can help to understand and respond to environmental crises. Discussions and readings emphasize the role of culture and aesthetics as agents and producers of environmental knowledge, highlighting their potential to challenge socio-ecological relations. Throughout the semester, students explore various themes, including colonialism, anthropocentrism, human-animal relations, fossil capitalism, indigenous ontologies, and the impact of extractive industries on territories and bodies in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Latinx world. Students engage with works by established and emerging artists, aiming to produce ecocritical knowledge about the current climate and environmental crisis. The course also offers a panoramic view of Latin American culture by examining some key historical events and authors whose works can shed light on cultural and ideological processes at the root of climate change. By the end of the semester, students can formulate research questions that are critical to the field of Latin American environmental humanities, as well as produce papers that are relevant to a broader debate about culture and ecology.

A,333,The Politics of Expertise,12405,PLSC,"<p style=""margin-left:.5in"">Few societies have been as reliant on experts as our own. As societies grow more complex and technology advances, so does the need for experts who have undergone years of specialized training. Ordinary citizens, firms, state bureaucracies, courts, and legislators constantly rely on experts to guide them in their decisions. However, this reliance is far from seamless. Opportunities to become a successful expert are uneven and often depend on circumstances beyond individual control. Specialists must counter public skepticism and compete with rival groups to establish their authority. Decision-makers are inundated with claims of expertise, making it challenging to discern between valid and dubious advice. Experts can exacerbate issues, fail catastrophically, or neglect public concerns to serve their own interests. Moreover, the increasingly specialized knowledge possessed by experts can seem esoteric and detached from everyday life, leading laypeople to view them with suspicion. For these reasons and others, the very notion of expertise has become highly politicized in recent years. Our society seems to be more and more divided between those who think that experts are indispensable to solve our problems, and those who see them as the root of our troubles. The course adopts an interdisciplinary perspective to explore these issues, drawing from both classical and modern research in sociology, political science, psychology, and philosophy.</p>",['YCSO'],0,['Federico Brandmayr'],['24657900'],[],"['Th 3.30-5.20', '1 HTBA RKZ 08']","['RKZ 08', '1 HTBA RKZ 08']",[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,The Politics of Expertise,PLSC,PLSC333,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99574/assignments/syllabus,202403

Should we have a representative system as opposed to something else like monarchy or direct democracy? Should representatives demographically resemble those they represent, or is that not necessary? How do things like congressional redistricting, electoral competition, and term limits affect the quality of representation? Do constituents’ preferences actually translate into policy in the United States, and if so, how?&#160;In Part I of this course, we discuss the theoretical foundations upon which representative government rests. In Part II, we move beyond theories of representation and on to the way political representation actually operates in the United States.

What is new about “surveillance capitalism” and what political and social repercussions are to be expected from the turn towards ‘data’ as one of the main engines of the economy? Would Universal Basic Income solve the looming problem of unemployment given the rise of generative AI? And how does AI affect our chances for “voice” as citizens? From echo chambers to mis/disinformation and deepfakes, how can we regulate how artificial intelligence changes our public sphere and discourse? Finally, how can we mobilize AI to improve our democratic institutions – from more responsive government, to digital forms of participation, and maybe even personalized law, what are the novel opportunities for a better democratic life that AI affords us? This course applies a political theory lens to these and related questions to investigate the social and political impact of artificial intelligence.<br /></p>

It aims to produce and disseminate knowledge, and to prepare graduates for work in all different kinds of fields. It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective.

The course addresses both historical and contemporary examples, providing a comprehensive view of how different administrations have navigated the challenges of bureaucratic management.

Our sources range widely across genres, media, periods, and geographies: from the ancient Near Eastern, <em>Epic of</em> <em>Gilgamesh</em> (1500 BCE) to the Southeast Asian <em>Ramayana</em>, to the Icelandic-Ukrainian climate activism film, <em>Woman at War </em>(2018). As part of the Six Pretty Good suite, we explore Yale's special collections and art galleries to broaden our perspectives on hierarchies of value and to sharpen our skills of observation and working with evidence. Six Pretty Good Heroes is a 1.5 credit course, devoting sustained attention students’ academic writing and is an excellent foundation for the next seven semesters at Yale. Required Friday sessions are reserved for writing labs and visits to Yale collections, as well as one-on-one and small-group meetings with the writing instruction staff.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",0,['Kathryn Slanski'],['11653488'],[],['TTh 9.00-10.15'],['HQ C07'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Enrollment litmited to first-year students.</p>",,YC,Yale College,['HUMS021'],01,A,,Six Pretty Good Heroes,NELC,NELC007,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99860/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,444,Classical Persian Lyric,12975,NELC,"<p>This course acquaints students with some of the most extraordinary lyric poets of classical Persian literature. We will read famous medieval figures and early modern luminaries. As we attend minutely to matters of grammar, form, prosody, and style, we will also keep in view relevant literary, cultural, historical, and intellectual contexts. An essential aim of the course is to introduce students to some of the ways in which the premodern Persian tradition thinks about itself. To that end, primary readings in poetry and literary prose are supplemented with short extracts from works by medieval and early modern critics, rhetoricians, theorists, and literary historians; these texts supply concepts and skills that are indispensable for reading, appreciating, and researching Persian literature. Achieving a fine-grained view of the tradition from within will illuminate our discussions as we consider the distinctiveness of the lyric form, probe various entanglements between literature, philosophy, and religion, and situate the premodern Persian literary tradition against broader comparative horizons that stretch across the Islamicate world and beyond.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Jane Mikkelson'],['24906474'],[],['TTh 1.00-2.15'],['YK220 002'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Intermediate reading knowledge of Persian</p>",NELC844,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Classical Persian Lyric,NELC,NELC444,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99974/assignments/syllabus,202403
A,133,Beginnings of Business: A History of Early Trade,14647,NELC,"<p>When did trade begin? When did business go global? How has the organization of commerce changed through time? What are our fundamental financial instruments and how and in what order where they developed? Are there fundamental rules behind the way in which humans conduct business? What roles have states and institutions historically played in facilitating or restricting trade? What sources and approaches are available to study trade in pre-modern times? Can business innovations from the past help us think about business in the present? To explore all these questions, this class draws upon data and case-studies drawn broadly from the ancient world but with focus on evidence from ancient Mesopotamia. With the benefit of a giant canvas of history we paint a detailed picture of how business developed through time. We look at examples where business was strictly regulated by state-controlled institutions as well as examples entrepreneurs would have to rely on informal enforcement mechanisms, such as kin-relationships and reputation in repeated interactions. We dive into the effects of shock on individuals and systems – from production shortages to pandemics. And we ask what happens when systems collapse, or value becomes immeasurable (as people have claimed for the 2008 crash). We study family-controlled business groups as an alternative to integrated and professionally managed corporations. And we observe how entrepreneurs adapted to face the financial challenges of states and dawning globalization. This course immerses students in the history of trade and draws on guests from widely different fields and disciplines to showcase the variety of approaches with which scholars address questions of business history.&#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YCSO']",50,['Gojko Barjamovic'],['17587095'],[],"['MW 11.35-12.50', '1 HTBA WALL53 208']","['WALL53 208', '1 HTBA WALL53 208']",[],,NELC517,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,A History of Early Trade,NELC,NELC133,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100786/assignments/syllabus,202403

Third, language has an enormous amount of hidden structure - words and other linguistic units can have complex relationships with each other that are not apparent on the surface.

The course will give an overview of the major theories in the field, focusing on the complex interaction between the developing self and the environment, exploring current research and theory as well as practice. Students will have the opportunity to see how programs for young children use psychodynamic and interactional theories to inform the development of their philosophy and curriculum. Weekly Observations:-Total Time Commitment 3 hours per week. Students will do two separate weekly observations over the course of the semester. They will observe in a group setting for 2 hours each each week at a Yale affiliated child care center.&#160; Students will also arrange to do a weekly 1 hour observation (either in person or virtually) of a child under the age of 6. Students must make their own arrangements for these individual observations. If it is not possible to arrange a child to observe, please do not apply to take this course. For a portion of class meetings, the class will divide into small supervisory discussion groups.</p>","['YCSO', 'YCWR']",50,"['Ann Close', 'Carla Horwitz']","['10338419', '10085017']",[],"['W 1.30-2.45', '1 HTBA SML 120C']","['SML 120C', '1 HTBA SML 120C']",[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Priority given to juniors, seniors, Ed Study students.</p>",CHLD125,YC,Yale College,['EDST125'],01,A,,Child Development,PSYC,PSYC125,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98235/assignments/syllabus,202403

This seminar revisits the key historical and aesthetic touchstones of “sapphism,” while engaging contemporary iterations of sapphic pop culture, from figures like K-Stew (Kristen Stewart), Janelle Monae, and a slew of “converted” reality contestants, to the controversies surrounding “Gaylorism” itself.

We examine how they are both shaped by and shape experiences of nationality, migration, and statelessness. Highlighting how gender and sexual minorities, and the gendered regulation of life, more broadly, both animate and contest colonial legacies tied to a racialized notion of “modernity.” Through ethnography, history, and literature, students confront a political economy of intimacies that continuously reshape what it means to be or not to be a citizen. Our approach extends beyond borders and laws to include the everyday acts of citizenship that rework race, religion, and ethnicity across transnational fronts. We discuss how people navigate their lives in the everyday, from the ordinary poetry of identity and belonging to the spectacular drama of war and conflict. Our goal is to challenge orientalist legacies that dismiss theoretical insights from scholarship on and from this region by labeling it as focused on exceptional cases instead of addressing “universal” issues. Instead, we take seriously that the specific historical and social contexts of the Middle East and North Africa reveal how connections based on gender and sexuality within and across families and social classes are deeply entwined with racial narratives of state authority and political sovereignty on a global scale.</p>",['YCSO'],0,['Eda Pepi'],['17310182'],[],['T 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C11'],[],,WGSS608,YC,Yale College,"['ANTH441', 'MMES430']",01,A,,Gender & Citizenship in MENA,WGSS,WGSS430,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98833/assignments/syllabus,202403
A,364,Feminism without Women: Modernist and Postcolonial Textual Experiments,11091,WGSS,"<p>Antifeminist critics charge the feminist movement with having forgotten “real women'' in favor of inaccessible theories rejecting the supposedly incontrovertible fact that there are only two sexes and genders. This seminar turns the charge on its head by exploring a theoretical and literary canon that - by questioning the ontological status of the male/female binary - has transformed feminism into a capacious, radically inclusive, revolutionary 21st Century movement. The texts and the theories that we discuss put pressure on the very category of “woman” as they strive to rethink feminism as a non-identitarian world-making project. The class focuses on two movements that employ art and literature to push back against the idea of “women” as the monolithic subject of feminism: Italian vanguard modernism and Italophone literary postcolonialism. We discuss modernist and postcolonial novels, poems, essays, and performative art pieces together with classics of feminist, queer and postcolonial theory.

Part educational presentation, part performance piece, the show was aired in millions of homes across the nation.

In effect, the course uses this aspect as a metonym for the racial, gender, sexual, and class heterogeneity of queer art and organizing.&#160;It conducts its investigation by looking at a variety of primary materials that illustrate the heterogeneous makeup of queer and trans politics.

A,212,Monogamy and its Discontents,11207,WGSS,"<p>While monogamy is central to Michel Foucault’s formulation of normative sexuality that arose in the 19th century (the Malthusian couple as adult, monogamous, heterosexual, married, and reproductive), little attention has been paid to it as a particular historical form of intimacy. We investigate this structure of intimacy through theoretical, historical, ethnographic, literary, and visual materials and think about the various meanings of monogamy historically as well as transnationally. Monogamy is entangled with relations of private property, with colonial civilizational narratives, with scientific theories about human nature. Polygamy in return has historically been understood as religious and/or cultural difference, and as a remnant of pre-modernity. The course weaves together theoretical readings that equip students with the tools to understand some key concepts that we need for our discussion, such as private property; the private family; colonialism and (cultural) imperialism; law and liberalism; and bourgeois morality with readings that more directly address some of the key ways in which monogamy is imagined, understood and framed. We discuss the turn to a recent rise in nonmonogamy in the “West” as a radical and “liberated” alternative to life-long or serial monogamy, at times featuring a critique of the private family, which constitutes a curious contrast to the nonmonogamy of religious and cultural Others of the West. Understanding the contemporary discourses and industries (books, podcasts, therapists’ youtube channels) around polyamory and nonmonogamy as a 21st century strategic unity, we analyze how liberalism has framed our understanding of sexual liberation and discuss alternative approaches to freedom.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Evren Savci'],['17502248'],[],['TTh 2.30-3.45'],['WLH 207'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Monogamy and its Discontents,WGSS,WGSS212,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98804/assignments/syllabus,202403

We examine manifestations of romantic love in medieval Arab cultures as precedents to the invention of courtly love.&#160;In the second part of our course, we turn to modern humanistic theories about romantic love. Among the questions that critical theorists and philosophers have posed, we consider: How is love related to desire? Is sexual desire an indispensable component of romantic love? Is romantic love ultimately a selfish, exclusionary act, or is it about renouncing the self, losing the self in the other?&#160;In the third part of our course, we apply the insights of parts 1 and 2 to discuss case studies of romantic love in the contemporary United States. In this section, we explore reining assumptions between romantic love and: marriage; monogamy; dating; the digital environment; queerness; age; and transnationalism.</p>",[],0,['Igor De Souza'],['17168521'],[],['T 3.30-5.20'],['HQ C07'],[],,,YC,Yale College,['AMST300'],01,A,,The Invention of Love,WGSS,WGSS350,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99489/assignments/syllabus,202403

Why does critical thinking so often compel an idiom of claiming, exploring, discovering, and mastering? What might writers strive for, if not newness, rigor, excellence, or even one’s own voice?&#160;In this class, we defamiliarize and repair the habits of mind and body that have been normalized by the university. Some of our time goes toward identifying the racial and colonial logics as well as presumptions about gender and ability that inform the conventions, genres, and styles of scholarly prose. For example, we contemplate the power relations and tonal effects embedded in the familiar maneuvers of advancing and defending arguments. Most of the class’s energy, however, is devoted to testing out less combative modes of inhabiting the page. We pursue these experiments not in the name of novelty but with the hope that our compositional practices can move us toward different values and different futures for writing, conversing, and living as subjects of the university. To guide us in this endeavor, we look to scholars who have critiqued the politics of knowledge by mobilizing alternative styles of knowing. Some, for example, have turned footnotes into an occasion for giving thanks instead of exhibiting mastery. Others have repurposed quotations and images in ways that challenge traditional regimes of evidence.&#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YENJ']",0,"['Sunny Xiang', 'Minh Vu']","['15861209', '17118422']",[],['T 9.25-11.15'],['WALL82 102'],[],,AMST428,YC,Yale College,"['ER&M448', 'ENGL332']",01,A,,Styles & Politics of Humility,WGSS,WGSS328,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99561/assignments/syllabus,202403

Human-generated data is being recorded at unprecedented rates and scales, and powerful AI and ML algorithms, which are capable of learning from such data, are increasingly controlling various aspects of modern society: from social interactions. These data-driven decision-making algorithms have a tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but, via the ability to mimic and nudge human behavior, they also have the potential to be discriminatory, reinforce societal prejudices, violate privacy, polarize opinions, and influence democratic processes. Thus, designing effective tools to govern modern society which reinforce its cherished values such as equity, justice, democracy, health, privacy, etc. has become paramount and requires a foundational understanding of how humans, data, and algorithms interact. This course is for students who would like to understand and address some of the key challenges and emerging topics at the aforementioned interplay between computation and society. On the one hand, we study human decision-making processes and view them through the lens of computation and on the other hand we study and address the limitations of artificial decision-making algorithms when deployed in various societal contexts.

By looking at how the ‘invisible’ was represented we may discover much about how these unseen beings were understood, but also something about how Roman art worked as a representational system.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",50,['Alexander Ekserdjian'],['25214565'],[],['TTh 2.30-3.45'],['LORIA 259'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Enrollment limited to first-year students.&#160;</p>",,YC,Yale College,['CLCV022'],01,A,,Invisible Roman World,HSAR,HSAR022,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98529/assignments/syllabus,202403

Discussions center on artworks from Latin America from the Pre-Hispanic to the Contemporary period—including Nazca lines, Maya ceramics, colonial-era mopa mopa, the early 20th-century Anthropophagy movement in Brazil, Hélio Oiticica’s and Lygia Clark’s works from the 1950s and 1970s, and the works of Beatriz Gonzales and Doris Salcedo from the 1980s and 1990s. Discussing these works, students address questions ranging from super-human scale to the diverse strategies artworks use to invoke bodies metonymically.

A,476,Energy Cultures of Modern Architecture,11686,HSAR,"<p>It is estimated that the construction and operation of buildings accounts for nearly 40% of carbon emissions globally. If a radical decarbonization of architectural practice stands as the discipline’s central challenge today, this calls not only for new solutions, but for different engagement with architecture’s history. This discussion seminar reinterprets histories of modern architecture through the concept of “energy cultures.” An energy culture (Sheller, 2014; Szeemann and Diamanti, 2019) can be defined as the specific assemblage of fuel, matter, practice, labor, and meaning that have informed architecture’s conceptualization and construction. In contrast to approaches that stress quantitative, technical, and instrumental approaches to energy accounting and energy efficiency, this course looks at how different representations, concepts, and behaviors emerged in response to historic shifts in energy production and consumption. The first portion of the course surveys a range of historical approaches to concepts of energy and environmental justice within and adjacent to architecture. The bulk of the course then turns to case studies, examining particular buildings and projects in order to develop new interpretations and questions about these monuments based on an energy cultures approach.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Craig Buckley'],['14909583'],[],['W 9.25-11.15'],['LORIA 358'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Energy Cultures of Modern Arch,HSAR,HSAR476,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99197/assignments/syllabus,202403
A,286,Renaissance Architecture: A Global History,11689,HSAR,"<p>The period known as the Renaissance (1400–1600) witnessed the rise and spread of ambitious new forms of architecture. During this era, builders pushed an earlier tradition of gothic design toward unprecedented heights of structural daring and ornamental expression. At the same time, they found inspiration in ancient pagan and non-European monuments, which offered alternative models of technical virtuosity, material splendor, and magnificence. Engineers invented fortifications of colossal scale to combat powerful gunpowder weapons, while new media such as print transmitted architectural designs across the globe.&#160;This course explores such developments across Europe and its cultural and colonial networks in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It surveys a wide range of Renaissance building types, from palaces and gardens to churches, civic buildings, and urban infrastructure.

In order to survive, these civilizations developed unique relationships with the landscape and its resources, such as potatoes, coca leaves, marine life, cotton, alpaca, and metals like silver, gold, and copper. These relationships were significantly transformed by the arrival of the Spanish, resulting in social upheaval, religious conversion, new economies, the development of hybrid artistic styles, and ecological catastrophes.

A,351,Early Film Theory and Modernity,10915,CPLT,"<p>For a long time, early film theory and criticism have been overlooked and underestimated. However, their recent rediscovery has highlighted their crucial role in framing film as a ""modern"" invention. While discussing what then was a recent invention, early film theory and criticism tackled some of the main characteristic of modern life: speed, excitation, contingency, openness, subjectivity, circulation, etc. By doing so, they underscored the parallel between modern experience and filmic representations. On the screen –they claimed– spectators do not only see the world in which they live, but also the effects of the political, industrial, and social revolutions on this world. At the same time, early film theory and criticism developed an ideal of “modern” art and “modern” language, through a systematic exploration of filmic style and iconography. According to them, film was the epitome of a “new art” for “new times.” The course explores the idea of modernity as it developed in the Western world between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. Despite this limitation, we do not meet a uniform landscape; on the contrary, ideological differences and national identities played a major role in defining the perspectives forged by film theorists and critics. While considering texts from France (Delluc, Epstein), Germany (Arnheim, Kracauer), Middle-Europe (Bálazs, Lukács, Tille), Italy (Papini, Thovez), Soviet Union (Eisenstein, Vertov, Pudovkin) and USA (Lindsay, Freeburg, Münsterberg), the course systematically and critically compares them and their traditions.

A,244,The Question of Technology in Continental Theory,11074,CPLT,"<p>In Greek mythology, Niobe is the queen of Thebes and mother of six daughters and six sons. She rebelled against the gods and was severely punished for it: her children were killed and she herself was petrified in eternal mourning. In Walter Benjamin's much-discussed essay ""On the Critique of Violence"", Niobe's fate is a memorial to a mythical violence that has never been overcome. According to Benjamin, this violence today is linked to an instrumental approach to technology. In the seminar, we discuss media and technology philosophical approaches by Benjamin, Heidegger, Simondon, Haraway, Chude-Sokei, among others, but also texts by Kant, in order to explore the question of how we should understand the entanglement of melancholy, violence and an instrumental understanding of technology. Furthermore, we discuss how this link between violence, technology and melancholy can be resolved from the perspective of Benjamin's critique of violence.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Astrid Deuber-Mankowsky'],['25450729'],[],['W 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C05'],[],,GMAN205,YC,Yale College,"['HUMS160', 'FILM205']",01,A,,Tech in Continental Theory,LITR,LITR244,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98463/assignments/syllabus,202403

This seminar turns the charge on its head by exploring a theoretical and literary canon that - by questioning the ontological status of the male/female binary - has transformed feminism into a capacious, radically inclusive, revolutionary 21st Century movement. The texts and the theories that we discuss put pressure on the very category of “woman” as they strive to rethink feminism as a non-identitarian world-making project. The class focuses on two movements that employ art and literature to push back against the idea of “women” as the monolithic subject of feminism: Italian vanguard modernism and Italophone literary postcolonialism. We discuss modernist and postcolonial novels, poems, essays, and performative art pieces together with classics of feminist, queer and postcolonial theory. We push our own political imagination further by asking ever more sophisticated questions about gender, sexuality, ethnicity, race, and the way these intersecting social formations mediate the way we see, experience, and represent our material and social reality.

Our reading takes us from the daily grind of contemporary Tokyo to dystopian futures, from 1970s suburbia to surreal dreamscapes. We attend carefully to the ways in which different writers craft their works and, in particular, to their representation of feelings and affects. Whether the dull ache of loneliness, the oppression of boredom or the heavy weight of fatigue, it is often something about the mood of a work–rather than its narrative–that leaves a distinct impression. We develop the tools to analyze and discuss this sense of distinctness, as well as discover ways to stage connections and comparisons between the works we read.&#160;</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Paul McQuade'],['25463394'],[],['TTh 11.35-12.50'],['HQ 127'],[],,EALL265,YC,Yale College,"['EAST253', 'EAST553']",01,A,,Japanese Literature after 1970,LITR,LITR251,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100946/assignments/syllabus,202403

Some of the projects happen in class. Most are out-of-class assignments for which I give specific problems to solve or parameters to work within. Some assignments we design as a class. When we are not shooting or editing in class we exercise our critical skills by screening projects and discussing them. We take experimental approaches to the process of making these 10 videos as we glance toward the standard cinematic categories of drama, documentary, experimental film, and animation as we glide past. These categories are familiar, but not always productive, divisions among modes of production since none of these categories defines clear boundaries between practices. Instead, this class leads us closer to understanding the complex array of contingencies impinging on all filmmaking processes. We take an ecologically based, transdisciplinary attitude rather than a categorized genre-based categorization. We continually ask, how do the various aspects and approaches to a filmmaking environment&#160; interact and modify each other?

C,431,The Other Side of French and Francophone Cinema,10261,FILM,"<p>What is the story of French and Francophone Cinema if told by other countries? May an external point of view engender a new interpretative move towards familiar topics and subjects? If French cinematography and its historical, aesthetical, and political evolutions has mainly unfolded from an internal and national standpoint, studies in transnational cinema demonstrate the impact of cultural circulations on the making of films and on the evolution of artistic movements. By examining how French and Francophone Cinema is seen and commented on from abroad--whether in the context of collaborations between countries or the way films and filmmakers are exposed, valorized, or on the contrary, silenced--this course puts into perspective the decisive role of external influences. We revisit early French films, canonical art works and different film productions from French-speaking countries while challenging monocultural interpretative paradigms. Such an approach underlies our critical examination of The Lumière Brother's world expeditions, Méliès's film subsidiary in the US, French artists in exile, the New Wave’s connections with other countries, and Jean Rouch’s cinema. Our focus on transnational perspectives sheds light on the links between cultural circulations, the postcolonial discourse and the politicizing of art, especially in North African French-speaking film productions. Spanning early to contemporary cinema, this course illuminates the local and global dimensions of French and Francophone cinema, as well as their intricate interconnections.</p>",['YCHU'],50,[],[],[],[],[],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,C,,Other Side of French Cinema,FILM,FILM431,,202403

A,460,Sound/Image Practice,10263,FILM,"<p>We start from the assumption that sound is actually the ‘secret-sauce’ in the film/videomaking process. Often overlooked–or at least neglected, sound is a potent tool to advance the logic of a film or video and even more, to enhance the emotional patina and immersive engagement of a film or video. Sound becomes an accessible portal to the perhaps overlooked not-quite-conscious realm of the film/video experience. While we certainly read some theory/history of sound, this is primarily a class of making. The first 7 weeks include videomaking exercises designed to highlight specific challenges in sound for picture. The core concern is with conceptual development in the myriad ways that sound and picture work together. There is no genre or mode preference in this class. Fiction, non-fiction, experimental, animation, game, tiktok, anything is okay. For the second half of the semester, each student (or collaborative small group–with permission) design, shoot, edit, and mix a short (3-5min) video of their own design–a video that demonstrates attention and developing sophistication in the use of sound with picture, as well as in how to design visual shots and temporal structures (editing) with sound in mind. The visual and auditory aspects of any video are entangled in such a way that contribute (when blended with the audience’s imagination and memory) to the formation of the Sound/Image in the audience member’s minds.</p>",[],50,['Leighton Pierce'],['25192142'],[],['T 1.30-5.20'],['CCAM 110'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Sound/Image Practice,FILM,FILM460,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98204/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,333,Early Film Theory and Modernity,10914,FILM,"<p>For a long time, early film theory and criticism have been overlooked and underestimated. However, their recent rediscovery has highlighted their crucial role in framing film as a ""modern"" invention. While discussing what then was a recent invention, early film theory and criticism tackled some of the main characteristic of modern life: speed, excitation, contingency, openness, subjectivity, circulation, etc. By doing so, they underscored the parallel between modern experience and filmic representations. On the screen –they claimed– spectators do not only see the world in which they live, but also the effects of the political, industrial, and social revolutions on this world. At the same time, early film theory and criticism developed an ideal of “modern” art and “modern” language, through a systematic exploration of filmic style and iconography. According to them, film was the epitome of a “new art” for “new times.” The course explores the idea of modernity as it developed in the Western world between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. Despite this limitation, we do not meet a uniform landscape; on the contrary, ideological differences and national identities played a major role in defining the perspectives forged by film theorists and critics. While considering texts from France (Delluc, Epstein), Germany (Arnheim, Kracauer), Middle-Europe (Bálazs, Lukács, Tille), Italy (Papini, Thovez), Soviet Union (Eisenstein, Vertov, Pudovkin) and USA (Lindsay, Freeburg, Münsterberg), the course systematically and critically compares them and their traditions.

She rebelled against the gods and was severely punished for it: her children were killed and she herself was petrified in eternal mourning. In Walter Benjamin's much-discussed essay ""On the Critique of Violence"", Niobe's fate is a memorial to a mythical violence that has never been overcome. According to Benjamin, this violence today is linked to an instrumental approach to technology. In the seminar, we discuss media and technology philosophical approaches by Benjamin, Heidegger, Simondon, Haraway, Chude-Sokei, among others, but also texts by Kant, in order to explore the question of how we should understand the entanglement of melancholy, violence and an instrumental understanding of technology. Furthermore, we discuss how this link between violence, technology and melancholy can be resolved from the perspective of Benjamin's critique of violence.</p>",['YCHU'],0,['Astrid Deuber-Mankowsky'],['25450729'],[],['W 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C05'],[],,GMAN205,YC,Yale College,"['HUMS160', 'LITR244']",01,A,,Tech in Continental Theory,FILM,FILM205,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98463/assignments/syllabus,202403

Domestically, martial arts films have served to promote the nation, while on the international arena, they have been one of the primary conduits of transnational cinematic interaction, as kung-fu or samurai films have influenced films inside and outside East Asia, from&#160;<em>The Matrix</em>&#160;to&#160;<em>Kill Bill</em>. Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity. It is thus not surprising that martial arts films have also attracted some of the world’s best filmmakers, ranging from Kurosawa Akira to Wong Kar Wai. This course focuses on films from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea—as well as on works from other countries influenced by them—covering such martial arts genres such as the samurai film, kung-fu, karate, wuxia, and related historical epics.

Vilém Flusser once remarked that the composite essence of digital technology was already embedded in photography because the photographic image is an image composed of points, which the human eye synthesizes into an image. This seminar proposes not only to revisit Flusser’s notion of the “technical image” in light of today’s changes in visual culture but also to rethink the history of image technologies beyond (or beneath) their visual dimensions. Starting with 15th- and 16th-century perspectival images and drawing tools—from Alberti’s “veil” to Dürer’s grid—, we trace the origins of the digital image with detours in the history of textile and the invention of the Jacquard loom, patented in 1804. Subsequently, the course analyzes 19th-century optical devices and so-called philosophical toys that required manual operation to produce the illusion of a moving image, fooling the human eye. Moving into the 20th century, Vertov’s “kino-eye” is reread as an early theory of machine vision. Other topics are: the indexicality of the photographic image, the haptic quality of the video image, the operational image of surveillance and warfare, the history of 3D images, CGIs, and GIFs.

What is left of this <em>Spiel-Raum</em> in cinema today? And how was it explored in the past decades? Was it limited to avant-garde practices or did it also expand to mainstream cinema? And what about the spectators? Is Benjamin’s notion turning them into players? This seminar proposes to rethink cinema as a form of play and to make connections, throughout history, with other playful media practices. Can for instance the Internet with its numerous GIF makers and social media platforms be considered as the new <em>Spiel-Raum</em>? How are contemporary online loops related to 19th-century optical toys and proto-cinematic slot machines? What made cinema the medium of “suspension of disbelief,” which is a form of pretend play? These and other questions are addressed to get to a better understanding of what cinema was and still is today. Therefore, the seminar revisits classical theories of play (Huizinga, Caillois, Winnicott) as well as contemporary game theories, which students are invited to apply to various film practices, ranging from avant-garde films to Nouvelle Vague productions and mind-game movies to selfie videos and playful recordings made with smartphones and other mobile devices.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Wanda Strauven'],['25493739'],[],['TTh 1.00-2.15'],['HQ 213'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Cinema as Room for Play,FILM,FILM382,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100181/assignments/syllabus,202403

A,390,"Media, AI and Algorithmic Bias",14328,FILM,"<p style=""margin-left:.25in"">Algorithms, a systematic way to perform a task in a finite number of steps, existed long before the computer was invented. In the digital age, algorithms are chains of actions or steps that define how software will perform and react. As such they condition, shape, and transform our daily lives: Algorithms play a crucial role in deciding which clothes we buy, which songs we listen to, which books we read, who we might date, and how much we would pay for a flight ticket. They help shift political opinions and shape cultural tastes. However, the logic on which algorithmic systems are based and the infrastructures that sustain them are still largely unknown to their users (and, increasingly, to their developers). This course explores several case studies – from Netflix’s recommendation system to Google’s autocomplete – in order to demystify the logic of algorithms and map the understudied ways in which they paradoxically decrease diversity of tastes, opinions, and experiences despite the techno-utopian promise of endless choice. This process of “un-black boxing” will emphasize “the implantation gap” in algorithmic systems and the ways in which they give birth to new systems of control, surveillance, and biopower.&#160; &#160;&#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",50,['Neta Alexander'],['25448043'],[],['TTh 11.35-12.50'],['HQ C05'],[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,"Media, AI and Algorithmic Bias",FILM,FILM390,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100620/assignments/syllabus,202403
A,426,Cinema of Crisis,14841,FILM,"<p>This course looks at European films dealing with various crises since 1945. The legacy of National Socialism, the rise of domestic and international terrorism (both before and after 9/11), the vast migrations of peoples, an increase in precarity, racism, and populism, the critique of capitalism, and the degradation of the environment—we examine these issues in films made after the end of World War II. Some of the questions that guide our inquiry are: When does violence seem like a legitimate answer to political, economic, and social pressures and the legacies of fascism and colonialism? Where and how do environmental issues come to the fore in an increasingly global Europe? How does cinema depict today’s multicultural societies in conflict? And how do gender issues inflect the precarious economic conditions shown in the films? Does the rise of digital technology inflect the way in which films portray history and memory? In directors’ varied aesthetic responses to death, displacement, and destruction, we find a growing consciousness of the social contradictions that lead to violence. This course seeks to define key words of cultural study such as public sphere, populism, precarity, neoliberalism, Anthropocene. It also seeks to give students insight into central concepts of film analysis (genre, spectatorship, point-of-view, audience, slow cinema). We take our case studies largely from Germany, Austria, France, and Italy. Films by Wolfgang Staudte, Alain Resnais, Alexander Kluge, Jean-Marie Straub, Volker Schlöndorff, Chris Marker, Werner Herzog, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Harun Farocki, Michael Haneke, Christian Petzold, Jessica Hausner, Nikolaus Geyrhalter, Julian Radlmaier, Hubert Sauper, Sudabeh Mortezai, Ruth Beckermann, among others.

We focus on personal films by filmmakers who consider themselves artists, activists, or agents of change but are united in their use of the nonfiction format to speak truth to power. In different ways, these films use media to build community and build family and ultimately, to build family albums and archives that future generations can use to build their own practices. Just as the family album seeks to unite people across time, space, and difference, the films and texts explored in this course are also journeys that culminate in linkages, helping us understand nuances of identity while illuminating personal relationships to larger cultural, social, and historical movements.</p>",['YCHU'],50,[],[],[],[],[],[],,AFAM216,YC,Yale College,[],01,C,,FamilyNarrativesCulturalsShift,FILM,FILM433,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100972/assignments/syllabus,202403

This course explores the Korean film history and aesthetics from its colonial days (1910-1945) to the hallyu era (2001-present), and also analyzes several key texts that are critical for understanding this field of study. How is Korean cinema shaped by (re)interpretations of history and society? How do we understand Korean cinema vis-à-vis the public memories of the Korean War, industrialization, social movements, economic development, and globalization? And how do aesthetics and storytelling in Korean cinema contribute to its popularity among local spectators and to its globality in shaping the contours of world cinema? By deeply inquiring into such questions, students learn how to critically view, think about, and write about film. Primary texts include literature and film.

A,454,Topics in Economic Inequality,14716,ECON,"<p>The course covers topics in economic inequality including attitudes towards inequality and support for redistribution, gender, household formation, and decision making, and the measurement of inequality across individuals and groups of individuals. We start by discussing some possible justifications for economic inequality, drawing on research in economics as well as philosophy. We then turn to discuss the evidence of what people prefer and believe about inequality, including their possible justifications for economic inequality. We discuss the views and beliefs of general populations across the globe. We further aim to relate these views and beliefs to political support for redistribution and welfare policies more generally. Gender inequalities in earnings may have historical roots and may persist because of contemporary norms supporting that men should be the breadwinners in the family.

Highlighting how gender and sexual minorities, and the gendered regulation of life, more broadly, both animate and contest colonial legacies tied to a racialized notion of “modernity.” Through ethnography, history, and literature, students confront a political economy of intimacies that continuously reshape what it means to be or not to be a citizen. Our approach extends beyond borders and laws to include the everyday acts of citizenship that rework race, religion, and ethnicity across transnational fronts. We discuss how people navigate their lives in the everyday, from the ordinary poetry of identity and belonging to the spectacular drama of war and conflict. Our goal is to challenge orientalist legacies that dismiss theoretical insights from scholarship on and from this region by labeling it as focused on exceptional cases instead of addressing “universal” issues. Instead, we take seriously that the specific historical and social contexts of the Middle East and North Africa reveal how connections based on gender and sexuality within and across families and social classes are deeply entwined with racial narratives of state authority and political sovereignty on a global scale.</p>",['YCSO'],0,['Eda Pepi'],['17310182'],[],['T 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C11'],[],,WGSS430,YC,Yale College,['ANTH441'],01,A,,Gender & Citizenship in MENA,MMES,MMES430,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98833/assignments/syllabus,202403

Students will explore the interplay between event and process; and between local developments and outside influence through topics including the arrival of immigrant populations and rice agriculture, political and trade relationships within the archipelago as well as on the Asian continent, and the emergence of political “statehood.”</p>",['YCSO'],50,['Scott Lyons'],['25539894'],[],['M 3.30-5.20'],['WTS A42'],[],,EAST428,YC,Yale College,['ANTH425'],01,A,,Archeology Protohistoric Japan,ARCG,ARCG425,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100514/assignments/syllabus,202403
A,353,The Archaeology of Trade and Exchange,14155,ARCG,"<p>This seminar will focus on archaeological approaches to exchange and trade. As background, we will review some of the principal theories of exchange from anthropology and sociology, such as those of Mauss, Malinowski and Polanyi. The role of trade and exchange in different kinds of societies will examined by contextualizing these transactions within specific cultural configurations and considering the nature of production and consumption as they relate to movement of these goods. We will consider methods and models that have been used to analyze regions of interaction at different spatial scales and the theoretical arguments about the social impact of inter-regional and intra-regional interactions involving the transfer of goods, including approaches such as world systems, unequal development and globalization. In addition, we will examine the ways that have been utilized in archaeology to identify different kinds of exchange systems, often through analogies to well documented ethnographic and historic cases. Finally, we will consider the range of techniques that have been employed in order to track the movement of goods across space. These sourcing techniques will be evaluated in terms of their advantages and disadvantages from an archaeological perspective, and how the best technical analyses may vary according to the nature of natural or cultural materials under consideration (ceramics, volcanic stone, metals, etc.). The theme for this year’s seminar is obsidian so students should select some aspect of obsidian research for their final paper and presentation.</p>",[],50,['Richard Burger'],['10255680'],[],"['1 HTBA', 'F 2.30-4.30']","['1 HTBA', 'HLH51 101']",[],,ARCG756,YC,Yale College,['ANTH756'],01,A,,Archaeology Trade and Exchange,ARCG,ARCG353,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100525/assignments/syllabus,202403

Playing games and reading books, we pose the following questions: How do players “perform” war in games, and how might they resist or subvert expected performances? How indeed are we as readers and players affected by the type of media we consume? What is an adaptation? How do adaptations influence or potentially reshape our relationships with the source material? What themes and ideas are revealed effectively through one medium versus another? Why do certain literary traditions (such as classical Russian literature) provide such fruitful ground for video game adaptation? What are the political implications for the ideologies present in a video game given the globalized position of the medium? Assigned readings include novels, short stories, news media, and internet forums alongside a range of secondary materials, including film and media theory, intellectual and media histories, digital anthropology, reception studies, and interviews.</p>",['YCHU'],50,['Spencer Small'],['17251736'],[],"['W 7.00-8.00p', 'TTh 11.35-12.50']","['HQ C07', 'WLH 013']",[],,,YC,Yale College,"['HUMS186', 'FILM369', 'RSEE244']",02,A,,War Games,RUSS,RUSS222,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99740/assignments/syllabus,202403

How wide is the gap? How can we bridge it? How pervasive is the problem? This course introduces first-year students to writing in the discipline of philosophy by tracing the contours of these questions and exploring their answers in ancient China, ancient Greece, and modern analytic philosophy. We begin by considering the traditional account of weakness of will as akrasia (i.e., doing what one knows one shouldn’t do) and explaining how such a gap in our agency is or isn’t possible. Next, we consider an alternative account, that of acedia (i.e., not doing what one knows one should do), and assess strategies for helping an agent bridge this kind of gap. Finally, we reassess the phenomenon of weakness of will in light of arguments that position it in a broader context, approach it from a new perspective, or try to rewrite our understanding of the phenomenon altogether.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",0,['James Brown-Kinsella'],['24544714'],[],['TTh 1.00-2.15'],['HQ 123'],[],,,YC,Yale College,"['EALL150', 'EAST307', 'CLCV121']",01,A,,Writing Philosophy: Akrasia,PHIL,PHIL100,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99245/assignments/syllabus,202403

The bulk of the course is devoted to a reading of Sartre’s master-work, <em>Being and Nothingness</em>. Themes we consider include realism and idealism; the difference between the “for itself” and “in-itself”; bad faith; “the look” and intersubjectivity; love; embodiment; sadism and masochism; freedom, responsibility, choice; the notion of a fundamental project and the desire to be God. In the remainder of the course, we consider Beauvoir’s moral philosophy, as set forth in an early essay and in her masterwork <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity </em>(traditionally, this work has been overshadowed by her <em>Second Sex</em>). Here, we devote attention to the idea of an existentialist ethics, and the demanding ideals of freedom and authenticity that are at its center. We also consider Beauvoir’s perspectives on patriarchy, racism, colonialism, and war.

A,202,"Power, Morals, and Double Standards: Human Rights in U.S. Foreign Policy",15439,GLBL,"<p>The role played in U.S. foreign policy by so-called values – the promotion of human rights and democracy; the prevention of mass atrocities; or humanitarian intervention, among others -- has long been a subject of controversy. Questions arise from several disparate directions. Some argue that incorporating moral judgments in the foreign policy decision-making is at odds with the pursuit of U.S. national interests. Others believe that American exceptionalism – the belief that the United States must act as a force for good in the world – is intrinsic to its national security and provides it with a unique comparative advantage vis-à-vis competing powers. Still others challenge the United States’ effectiveness in pursuing a values-centered foreign policy, its sincerity, or both -- pointing to a history in which the exercise of American power has had devastating consequences for its purported beneficiaries, or been marred by blatant double standards and hypocrisy. This course takes a closer look at the debate surrounding these issues from an historical, intellectual, and practical viewpoint. When, how, and why did various U.S. administrations come to emphasize notion of morality as a central dimension of their foreign policy? Have the strategies they have carried out been successful in advancing the values they claim to embody and, if not, why not? What has been the reaction of governments and citizens on the receiving end of American encouragement, pressure, sanctions, or military intervention? Can an administration justifiably claim to place values at the center of its foreign policy if it does so irregularly, a function of whether the target government is friend or foe?</p>",['YCSO'],50,['Robert Malley'],['25230681'],[],"['W 3.30-5.20', '1 HTBA BASSLB L73']","['BASSLB L73', '1 HTBA BASSLB L73']",[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,"Power, Morals, & Human Rights",GLBL,GLBL202,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/101119/assignments/syllabus,202403

The international community, which often leads warring parties to the table, takes on a new role also, informing and sometimes deforming outcomes. Building a durable peace requires a sensitivity to the changing priorities of the signatories and international community, as well as the constituencies for whom the peace was achieved. Anchored in (but not limited to) the ongoing UN-supported peace agreement implementation process in Mali and the monitoring process of the Final Agreement to End Armed Conflict and Build a Stable and Lasting Peace in Colombia, the seminar considers peace-building processes from the perspectives of formerly warring parties, diplomats, NGOs, and civil society, providing students an opportunity to begin to catalogue strategies for building durable peace following conflict.&#160;</p>",['YCSO'],36,['Bisa Williams'],['24488342'],[],"['1 HTBA WTS A39', 'M 1.30-3.20']","['1 HTBA WTS A39', 'WTS A39']",[],,,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,Turning Points Peace Building,GLBL,GLBL430,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/102607/assignments/syllabus,202403

During this era, builders pushed an earlier tradition of gothic design toward unprecedented heights of structural daring and ornamental expression. At the same time, they found inspiration in ancient pagan and non-European monuments, which offered alternative models of technical virtuosity, material splendor, and magnificence. Engineers invented fortifications of colossal scale to combat powerful gunpowder weapons, while new media such as print transmitted architectural designs across the globe.&#160;This course explores such developments across Europe and its cultural and colonial networks in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It surveys a wide range of Renaissance building types, from palaces and gardens to churches, civic buildings, and urban infrastructure. Lectures consider how buildings and cities were reshaped by urban elites, absolutist monarchs, religious warfare, paper and print, and global expansion.

Aristotle’s conflation of matter with error suggests error as able to provides a ‘way-in’ to the (always closed) question of matter. Might the symptomatic excess of precision that the century witnessed, inflated beyond practicable performance, signal nothing less than the architect’s fear of matter itself? As precision, already a promiscuous term, became uncoupled from its contract with truthfulness, error, and the always-political space of its identification, reconfigured in newly unpredictable ways. With reference to disciplines and practices that have interrogated precision and failure with more curiosity than has architecture–historians of science, and visual artists Matta-Clark, Hepworth, Whiteread, and Celmins–the sessions will explore what architecture might learn from error and its ever-inventive tactics of dissent. Two concluding sessions ask: where precision and error relations now stand in contemporary architecture as what we daily put in the cloud threatens to exhaust the ground beneath our feet?</p>",[],50,['Francesca Hughes'],['25526855'],[],['Th 3.30-5.20'],['LORIA 358'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Familiarity with general history of modern art and architecture preferred.</p>",,YC,Yale College,[],01,A,,The Architecture of Error,ARCH,ARCH364,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/100317/assignments/syllabus,202403

It aims to produce and disseminate knowledge, and to prepare graduates for work in all different kinds of fields. It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective. Topics include: tenure, endowments, the committee system, the growth of degrees, the aims of research, peer-review, the nature of disciplinary divisions, as well as a host of other issues.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCSO']",50,['Mordechai Levy-Eichel'],['12681869'],[],['Th 1.30-3.20'],['HQ 317'],[],,PLSC281,YC,Yale College,"['HIST404', 'HUMS303']",01,A,,What is the University?,EDST,EDST281,,202403

This course analyzes the ways in which Romans imagined these ‘invisible’ beings, excavating their imaginings through texts and objects. The material covered traces ancient imagination of invisible beings from Celtic cauldrons to Roman poets, and marble statues to painted synagogues.

This course introduces first-year students to writing in the discipline of philosophy by tracing the contours of these questions and exploring their answers in ancient China, ancient Greece, and modern analytic philosophy.

Next, we consider an alternative account, that of acedia (i.e., not doing what one knows one should do), and assess strategies for helping an agent bridge this kind of gap. Finally, we reassess the phenomenon of weakness of will in light of arguments that position it in a broader context, approach it from a new perspective, or try to rewrite our understanding of the phenomenon altogether.</p>","['YCHU', 'YCWR']",0,['James Brown-Kinsella'],['24544714'],[],['TTh 1.00-2.15'],['HQ 123'],[],,PHIL100,YC,Yale College,"['EALL150', 'EAST307']",01,A,,Writing Philosophy: Akrasia,CLCV,CLCV121,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99245/assignments/syllabus,202403

This course focuses on the intersections between aesthetics and ecological practices in the context of the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch wherein humans have become a major geological force shaping the planet. It challenges traditional approaches by examining how culture and the arts can help to understand and respond to environmental crises. Discussions and readings emphasize the role of culture and aesthetics as agents and producers of environmental knowledge, highlighting their potential to challenge socio-ecological relations. Throughout the semester, students explore various themes, including colonialism, anthropocentrism, human-animal relations, fossil capitalism, indigenous ontologies, and the impact of extractive industries on territories and bodies in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Latinx world. Students engage with works by established and emerging artists, aiming to produce ecocritical knowledge about the current climate and environmental crisis. The course also offers a panoramic view of Latin American culture by examining some key historical events and authors whose works can shed light on cultural and ideological processes at the root of climate change. By the end of the semester, students can formulate research questions that are critical to the field of Latin American environmental humanities, as well as produce papers that are relevant to a broader debate about culture and ecology.

This new scholarship has advanced the academic state of knowledge and sharpened our collective ability to understand human-environmental relations. Yet despite better science, we struggle to make material change in the collective rate of human consumption of Earth’s natural resources. Not only is the planet harmed by our failures, but millions of people are also harmed. Embedded in all scientific endeavors is a theory of change. But rarely are theories of change made explicit for environmental stewardship. In this course, we investigate new bodies of scholarship that explore relational values, varying concepts of stewardship, a range of theories of change, and, finally, capabilities or human rights-based measure of the life well lived. We explore the following questions: What does it mean to be an environmental steward in a world filled with social, political, and economic inequalities? How can we weave together multiple knowledge systems or ways of knowing through environmental stewardship? How can we balance the need for social and environmental change in a way that is both place-based and responsive to global concerns?

Looking especially at the sphere of cultural production, it focuses on the question of what it means to be modern as expressed through the tension between resurgent neonationalism and the aspiration to internationalize. The course charts how the legacy of Japan’s imperial failure plays a significant role in its search for renewal and identity since 1945. How, it asks, does the experience of catastrophic failure—and failure to account for that failure—play into continued aspirations for modernity today? How does Japanese society wrestle with modernity’s two faces: its promise for progress and its history of catastrophic violence? The course follows the trajectory of Japan’s postwar nation-state development after the dissolution of empire, from its resurrection out of the ashes after defeat, to its identity as a US ally and economic superpower during the Cold War, to decades of recession since the 1990s and the search for new relations with its neighbors and new reckonings with its own imperial violence and postwar inactions against the background of rising neonationalism.</p>","['YANS', 'YCHU', 'YCSO']",0,['Yukiko Koga'],['24306272'],[],['W 3.30-5.20'],['WTS A74'],[],,,YC,Yale College,['EAST313'],01,A,,Contemporary Japan,ANTH,ANTH213,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98167/assignments/syllabus,202403

Through the lens of memory, we examine complex roles that our relationships to difficult pasts play in navigating issues we face today. This course explores this politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. The class asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the US, this course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.</p>","['YANS', 'YCHU', 'YCSO']",0,['Yukiko Koga'],['24306272'],[],['T 1.30-3.20'],['SA10 105'],[],,ANTH824,YC,Yale College,['EAST324'],01,A,,Politics of Memory,ANTH,ANTH324,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98188/assignments/syllabus,202403

Highlighting how gender and sexual minorities, and the gendered regulation of life, more broadly, both animate and contest colonial legacies tied to a racialized notion of “modernity.” Through ethnography, history, and literature, students confront a political economy of intimacies that continuously reshape what it means to be or not to be a citizen. Our approach extends beyond borders and laws to include the everyday acts of citizenship that rework race, religion, and ethnicity across transnational fronts. We discuss how people navigate their lives in the everyday, from the ordinary poetry of identity and belonging to the spectacular drama of war and conflict. Our goal is to challenge orientalist legacies that dismiss theoretical insights from scholarship on and from this region by labeling it as focused on exceptional cases instead of addressing “universal” issues. Instead, we take seriously that the specific historical and social contexts of the Middle East and North Africa reveal how connections based on gender and sexuality within and across families and social classes are deeply entwined with racial narratives of state authority and political sovereignty on a global scale.</p>","['YANS', 'YCSO']",0,['Eda Pepi'],['17310182'],[],['T 1.30-3.20'],['HQ C11'],[],,WGSS430,YC,Yale College,['MMES430'],01,A,,Gender & Citizenship in MENA,ANTH,ANTH441,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/98833/assignments/syllabus,202403

As a result, there has been an urgent interest to understand who American Muslims are by officials, experts, journalists, and the public. Although Muslims have been part of America’s story from its founding, Muslims have alternated from an invisible minority to the source of national moral panics, capturing national attention during political crises, as a cultural threat or even a potential fifth column. Today the stakes are high to understand what kinds of meanings and attachments connect Muslims in America to the Muslim world and to the US as a nation.&#160;Over the course of the semester, students grapple with how to define and apply the slippery concept of diaspora to different dispersed Muslim populations in the US, including racial and ethnic diasporas, trading diasporas, political diasporas, and others. By focusing on a range of communities-in-motion and a diverse set of cultural texts, students explore the ways mobility, loss, and communal identity are conceptualized by immigrants, expatriates, refugees, guest-workers, religious seekers, and exiles. To this end, we read histories, ethnographies, essays, policy papers, novels, poetry, memoirs; we watch documentary and fictional films; we listen to music, speeches, spoken word performances, and prayers.

Mauss’s insight has sprung a series of studies on embodiment that examine how bodies are culturally construed. Engaging literature on embodiment from diverse disciplines—including philosophy, anthropology, and cognitive science—this course investigates how cultural understandings of the body inform the meaning of artmaking and art-experiencing practices. Discussions center on artworks from Latin America from the Pre-Hispanic to the Contemporary period—including Nazca lines, Maya ceramics, colonial-era mopa mopa, the early 20th-century Anthropophagy movement in Brazil, Hélio Oiticica’s and Lygia Clark’s works from the 1950s and 1970s, and the works of Beatriz Gonzales and Doris Salcedo from the 1980s and 1990s. Discussing these works, students address questions ranging from super-human scale to the diverse strategies artworks use to invoke bodies metonymically. Comparative artworks from other cultures and periods show the applicability of this methodology beyond Latin American art.

A,228,Borders & Globalization in Hispanophone Cultures,11337,LAST,"<p class=""p1"">The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives.&#160;Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization?&#160;</p>","['YCHU', 'YCL5']",50,['Luna Najera'],['24174403'],[],['TTh 11.35-12.50'],['HQ 133'],[],"<p class=""prerequisites"">Prerequisite: SPAN 140 or 145, or in accordance with placement results.</p>

A,350,Ecologies of Culture: Latin American Environmental Aesthetics,12399,LAST,"<p>In the age of rising sea levels, mass extinction, and carbon-driven climate change, can culture and the arts remain unchanged? This course focuses on the intersections between aesthetics and ecological practices in the context of the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch wherein humans have become a major geological force shaping the planet. It challenges traditional approaches by examining how culture and the arts can help to understand and respond to environmental crises. Discussions and readings emphasize the role of culture and aesthetics as agents and producers of environmental knowledge, highlighting their potential to challenge socio-ecological relations. Throughout the semester, students explore various themes, including colonialism, anthropocentrism, human-animal relations, fossil capitalism, indigenous ontologies, and the impact of extractive industries on territories and bodies in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Latinx world. Students engage with works by established and emerging artists, aiming to produce ecocritical knowledge about the current climate and environmental crisis. The course also offers a panoramic view of Latin American culture by examining some key historical events and authors whose works can shed light on cultural and ideological processes at the root of climate change. By the end of the semester, students can formulate research questions that are critical to the field of Latin American environmental humanities, as well as produce papers that are relevant to a broader debate about culture and ecology. Lastly, the course hopes to motivate students—beyond the classroom—to examine their place in an increasingly warming world. <strong>Taught in Spanish.</strong></p>","['YCHU', 'YCL5']",50,['Santiago Acosta'],['25126811'],[],"['TTh 11.35-12.50', '1 HTBA HQ 123']","['HQ 123', '1 HTBA HQ 123']",[],,SPAN365,YC,Yale College,"['HUMS452', 'EVST266']",01,A,,Ecologies of Culture,LAST,LAST350,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/99569/assignments/syllabus,202403

The author was Indigenous Andean Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala (c. 1535–c. 1616). This work is one of the most important sources for understanding Inka culture and colonial rule from an Indigenous perspective. It consists of 1,189 pages with 398 full-page ink line drawings.

While social, legal, political, and economic factors vary within and between the countries of the region, since the 1980s, many countries that faced authoritarian regimes transitioned to democracy; Most children in the region now have access to healthcare and attend school; The subcontinent is at the center of the climate justice agenda while dealing with new forms of colonialism from the “Global North”; Latin America is pioneering women’s inclusion in politics, parity policies, and legal landmarks to combat gender-based political violence; Latin American feminism, queer activism, and movements advocating for the rights of black people, indigenous communities, and environmental protection are vibrant and have achieved pivotal accomplishments.
